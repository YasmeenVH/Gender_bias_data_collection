"The older you are, the harder dating typically seems."
"The on-line dating site Zoos even found that while describing what they want in a woman, men increasingly mention intelligence the older they get."

"There's also a chance he's just insecure and hoping to show off, but in most cases, this behaviour is also a sign he's a player."

There's nothing better than a smart woman everyone can agree on that.
There's nothing quite like getting deep into an intellectual conversation with someone who knows how to talk.
"These persons flaw will become apparent eventually, and they'll be things you do and don't like about them."
These tall tales just get you giddy and excited about the idea of potential love.
They also don't like unnecessary baggage.
They also like the fact that intelligence means their future partner likely has a career and is capable of taking care of herself financially if necessary.
They don't broadcast their relationship on social media and probably don't share every last detail of their romantic encounters with their friends.
They don't care if you wear heels.

They really love to be appreciated.
They understand how to balance everything in life.

Women at this stage often have never married for certain reasons (like a engaged career) or have separated from their partner due to death or divorce.
"Women have it tough there are a lot of timeliness that society has set up, so many of us feel like we need to be married by a certain age."
"Women in general have a wonderful intuition, and if a woman in her 50s has been single for long enough, she's pretty much seen all types of men and women cross her path."
Women in their 40s and 50s feel even stronger about this.
Women like men who know their way around the globe.
"Women need positive feedback to stay engaged, according to Dr. Tina B. Messina, PhD, psychotherapist and author of, Dr. Romances Guide to Finding Love Today."

"Women want to be your partner, she doesn't want another person to take care of."
"Yes, it might be uncomfortable, and no, you don't want to hurt her feelings."
"Yes, that includes women in their 20s."
You aren't opening up emotionally.
"You can learn a lot from body language, especially if you're trying to feel out how someone feels about you."
"You can tell a lot from a men body language whether or not he's interested, whether he wants to kiss you, or whether he's engaged in the conversation."
You can tell her through words or even physically.
You don't have to be extraordinary.
"You don't have to wear a three-piece suit, but you should spend a little time on your outfit, hair, and appearance for your date."
You don't make plans together.
You don't miss her.
You get pure clarity because he wants to know you're ready for him too.
You have the numbers to prove it.
You just never how someone will measure up.
You just want to find out if the details they gave you match what you found.
"You know how younger women sometimes have a tendency to take on the personality, habits, or routines of their partner?"
You may be surprised by how easy it can be.
"You may feel like he's just being flirty and fun, but if you're not looking for something casual, you may want to slow things down."
"You may feel like you're not getting the attention you want, but if your partner is preoccupied with work, kids, errands, or just life in general it's not that she doesn't care about you or love you, but its very difficult to put all that aside."
"You seem kind of distant lately, may give you the answers you're looking for."
You should definitely do some talking women like it when men open up about their interests.
You should never lie on a date something like that may end up haunting you if the relationship progresses.
"You shouldn't expect to feel that way forever, but finding ways to spend time together should still be at the front of your mind."
You wont have to worry about whether or a man over 50 likes you hell let you know.
You'll have to mix it up and get personal with whoever you decide to spend your time with.
"You're dating a woman and it seems like things are going great until suddenly she stops testing you to ask how your day went, she's not initiating outings like she once did, and when are together she's looking at her phone or only half-interested in the conversation."
"You're losing a partner and, most times, a friend."
"You're not checking for texts or emails, or the latest tweet."
You're not excited to see her and get this nagging thought that you should be.
You're reluctant to commit to her.
"You've probably heard the phrase, You can't teach an old dog new tricks, before."
