What do men want is a brilliant question that has confused women since the beginning of time.
"Men are strange, yet often simple creatures who are on a constant quest to define themselves in a world that no longer cares what they accomplish."
There are no valiant causes to fight for.
There are no more glaring injustices to stand against.
"Even if he went off to fight in any of the current worldwide conflicts, he would not really be looked upon with pride."
He's more likely to be met with the sadness and grief that war creates.
Men are lost.
The things that used to mean something have lost their meaning so meaningless pursuits have taken their place.
All you have to do is listen to the messages of pop culture to see that disrespect and criminal behavior are the new pursuits.
"If you asked a man today what he wants, he might not even be able to tell you."
"This leads us to you, the last true and traditional pursuit that a man can be proud of."
The answer to  what do men want is actually easier and more simple than you might have imagined: who cares?
Uh oh time to explain.
"If you spend your life trying to figure out what do men want, youre going to always be in unfulfilling relationships."
The better question is: what does the man you love want and how does that fit into what you want?
"Any time you generalize into what groups of people do or dont do, youre bound to get it wrong at least a third of the time."
What is important to him?
What are his opinions about the world around him?
And probably the most important question: what is he looking for in love?
"Without any kinds of rites of passage any more to let him know hes now a man, nowadays its cool to remain a big fat baby."
He might not want to get too close because that would be a commitment.
Too scary!
"This is probably a very small segment of the dating population, but its important to get a basic dating history."
"If hes never had a relationship longer than a few months, what does he want?"
Hes likely not to be looking for love.
He might not even know what to do with love.
How do you find this out?
Flat out ask him!
How long was your longest relationship?
"Thats not to say that you cant be his first real love in his life, but you are going to have to put some serious effort into becoming irresistible to him."
Thats right!
"If you want to keep one of the un-catchables, you should probably read this book on how to captivate him completely."
"If you really have to boil it down, men want six basic things:"
"To be honest, nothing."
"You can choose to work on all of these aspects, but whats most important is what you want to do for him?"
Stay with me for a second what if you always gave him good loving without that little expectation to get something back?
What if you thought of new little ways to show him how much you cherish him all the time?
You dont need to work on what do men want if you want to give him everything.
Give love never expecting reciprocation and hell step up too.
Think of it as a rising tide.
"As the water (or love) flows in, it raises all the boats in the marina."
"What if you were always there to give back rubs, have great conversations, cook and appreciate good food, and any other loving gestures you could think of without ever complaining about your needs?"
He would feel compelled to give back to you.
"Of course, as stated above, some dudes are giant babies and will never feel the need to give back."
Hopefully youve been able to weed these losers out before you give him such good loving.
So dont be so concerned about what do men want.
"Instead, think about how much you are willing to give to your relationship and his needs will all be covered."

so theres this guy
Hes perfect.
"It seems like he might, but you are dying to know, Does he like me?"
So many people get lost on the very first step of dating.
"You both think the other person is into you, but sometimes its hard to tell."
"He sends so many confusing and conflicting messages, you dont know what to do."
You think hes great.
You like the way he makes you feel (sometimes!).
"Hes even in your dreams, but youre afraid of embarrassing yourself by pursuing that guy because hes so hard to figure out."
"Chances are, if youre this confused, he really is attracted to you."
The whole dating ritual between men and women is full of confusing undertones and bizarre rituals that neither one of you are even aware you are doing.
So many loves get lost in the confusion
"If you go through all of these attraction signs and youre still not sure, then its time to take things into your own hands."
"Read the book The Art of Irresistible by one of our favourite writers for this site, Roberto Hogue."
Its time to really get what you want: this guy!
"Time waits for no woman and the longer you wait, the better chance that someone else will swoop in and bag your boy!"
Some guys are just incurable flirts.
Hell chat up any girl he sees.
Most guys only flirt with the one they are interested in.
Pay attention to how he acts around other women.
Does he say the same things to them as he does to you?
Does he have the same kind of nervous shyness around them too?
"If not, you can bet hes attracted to you."
Men change around someone they like.
Think of gorillas thumping their chest to impress a hot lady gorilla.
Does he try to show off around you?
Does he do weird things around you that he does not do around other girls?
On the Does He Like Me Scale this is as close to a ten as you can get.
"Compliments are obvious signs of attraction, but being mean?!!"
How does being mean show that hes attracted to you?
"It seems impossible, but watch any TV show about the mating rituals of mammals and youll often see the male being a jerk to the female."
Its a very primal instinct that men have.
"Does he insult you, but then always try to be around you?"
"Is it obvious that hes interested in you, but then he says something mean to you?"
You can guarantee that most guys dont even realize they do this.
But think about what this accomplishes in your mind: you cant stop thinking about him!
You spend your days adding up all the nice things he does and then youre stuck analysing the mean things.
Mission accomplished!
He has you confused and crazy.
Does He Like Me Scale: 7.5
You avoid people that you dont like.
You hang out with your friends.
You go out of your way to spend time with people youre attracted to.
Same goes with the fell as.
"If he always seems to be around wherever you are, you can bet he likes you."
"If it seems like a big inconvenience for him to always swing by, its a great sign hes attracted to you."
We gravitate towards people we are interested in.
Does he get a little too far into your personal space?
Is he always leaning towards you?
Does he touch you?
Notthat kind of touch!
Does he bump into you or touch your back or arm when he sees you?
This includes the mean touch like playfully trying to trip you or pushing you away.
"Think about this: when someone pushes you, its usually in anger."
If hes not angry then hes obviously doing it for some other reason
"If you are tripped up wondering if a guy likes you, do yourself a favour and really learn body language."
We all act a certain way when we are dealing with our feelings.
We simply cant hide it!
Check out Body Language Flirting to knowexactly what hes thinking at any given moment.
This book comes free with The Art of Irresistible and gives valuable insight on how to say everything without even saying a word.
It also helps decode what hes really trying to say!
Men are not the masters of body language that women are.
They are not very subtle.
Any time he touches you or takes a forward posture is a great sign of attraction.
Learning how to read this very powerful language will truly make you unstoppable!
"Not only that, you wont embarrass yourself by going for guys who arent interested."
This can go in one of two possible directions.
If hes shy he might avoid eye contact at all costs if he really likes you.
"If hes not shy, he will do his best to catch your eye."
Try to get the shy guy to look you in the eyes.
Hell give away his feelings for you faster than anything.
"If hes not the shy type, stare him down."
Sometimes its those small awkward moments that send you both into each others arms.
Read this great article on eye contact flirting to learn some great skills on using your eyes to say everything.
"In the mean time, when you get caught in one of these stare-downs, try leaning towards him."
"If he leans in with you, youre in."
Go for the kiss if youre really feeling it!
Which brings us to
"When we develop a closeness to someone, we unconsciously start to mirror their actions."
"As you talk to him, touch your ear (or hair or some part of your body) and if he repeats this action within a few minutes, hes showing his interest in you."
It could be as simple as him always taking a drink soon after you do.
So hes doing most if not all of the signs of attraction and the readings on the Does He Like Me Scale are through the roof.
How do you get him to make the first move?
The answer is that he NEVER makes the first move.
"Sure, he might one day come up to you and ask you out, but you made all the little first moves up until that point."
Show interest in him.
Ask him questions about his interests.
Touch him back.
"Compliment him for something and yes, be mean back to him!"
"Of course if you really want to be a ninja about all of this, you live without the book, Rousing the Lion."
Find out ways that you can be mysterious to him right away!
"If youEUR(TM)re really serious about bagging this guy, then you really need to bring out the big guns and stop waiting for something to happen."
"If all else fails to bring that boy to action, you have to come right out and call him on it:"
I think its weird that you havent asked me out on a date.
Whoa girl!
No one has ever said that to him before!
"Even if he was on the fence about you, now hes impressed."
"Not only that, youre not really putting yourself that far out there for embarrassment."
"Even if he counters with, Because I dont wanna, you can answer with Hmmm, interesting."
And hes still in the hot seat!
If you make enough observations even the shyest guys will break down and ask you out.
"You no longer have to worry, Does he like me?"
and get on with what youve wanted all along: an awesome relationship.

"When it comes to seducing men, there are right ways and a whole lotta wrong ways."
"The trick is to be assertive, yet subtle."
"Thats right, men are as intuitive as a shrub when it comes to interpreting your interest."
You could be doing every possible move in the book and he might still be scratching his head wondering if you like him.
"If you really like this guy, you have to show him a few indicators of interest."
We prefer to give you a whole life approach.
Seduction doesnt just start with with a cmere sailor look and kissy lips.
It starts from the moment you wake up.
"Its the way you dress, your hair, make up and how you smell."
Its in the way that you move and how you own your world.
The seduction started the moment you decided to become a seductress.
Does this make any sense to you?
Women with personal power are seductive without doing anything.
"When youKNOW that he deserves a girl like you, youve already seduced him!"
"Its a big concept, but its one you really need to have mastered to get the guys you want."
"To really get good at this concept, check out our favorite book on the subject: The Art of Irresistible and make yourself into someone he cant say no to."
"If you need more about this subject or have some stories of your own, check out our brand new reader powered section on seduction stories."
You can find somevery specific ways that other women are tackling how to seduce a man.
Tell us what works for you!
So how do you show your intent without looking like a perv?
"Before we get to the playing with the hair stuff, you have to have the appearance that you are looking for a man."
You cant go to work or school everyday looking like a slob.
"Many guys have admitted that they were attracted to someone, but gave up because the way she dressed indicated she wasnt on the market."
Its a common mistake that many women make.
Put a little effort into the way you look and show him that you are serious about getting his attention.
Dont you always notice the well dressed men first?
That same attraction principle applies to you.
Very few women actually interact with men using their sensuality.
What is sensuality?
"For one, its not about chatting and blabbing on about things he would never be interested in."
"Sensuality is slow, graceful movement."
Speaking softly in a sexy purr.
Watch a cat saunter across the room and rub the length of its body along a chair.
This is the message you want to send to him.
This is what seducing men is about!
Another thing that is not sensuality is sexuality.
Sexuality is for those girls who are not yet confident in their skills.
They dress too slutty with too much make up and flaunt their womanhood blatantly.
"Make no mistake, this will get the attention of men."
"If youre looking for a one night stand, then tart yourself up by all means."
"If youre looking for something a little bit more substantial, then you need to be seducing men with your sensuality."
Sensuality is screaming a confidence in your womanhood and your sexuality without obscene gestures or any words at all.
Think about a beefy biker dude.
Immediately you assume hes a cold-blooded killer.
He doesnt have to say a word.
He avoids trouble by looking troublesome.
Your goal is effortlessly seducing men by being sensual.
"When you bring this feline energy into a room, he cant help but feel attraction."
Sensuality does not include talking about sex.
"In fact, any blatant comment about sex, your body parts, or your sexual skills are pretty much a bad idea."
Inexperienced men will get nervous and maybe get the wrong idea.
Experienced men usually know that talk is almost always just talk and any woman who talks about their skills doesnt really have any.
Nothing is more intoxicating than confidence.
"If you want to get his attention,deserve his attention."
"Sorry to say this, but shy girls rarely get the guy she wants."
"Beyond that, weak guys are terrified of strong women so they go for the shy ones."
"If you really want an incredible guy and want to get good at seducing men, you have to own it!"
What does that mean exactly?
Its a state of mind.
Its knowing what you want and what you dont want.
Being able to take his attitude and dishing it right back without getting upset or angry.
"Again, this whole interaction really is a game."
"The better you know how to play it, the more fun youll have."
Perhaps the best way to find out how powerful your inner confidence can be is through the Unstoppable Confidence program.
There is so much outstanding information in this system that will echo into every aspect of your life.
Want to get a better job?
Want an awesome boyfriend?
"Want to seduce that sexy guy at the end of the bar, it all starts here with your unstoppable confidence."
"If your shyness is a bit more deep seated than that, itEUR(TM)s time to take out the big guns and check out Panic Away."
Panic Away teaches a really easy step by step method on how to let go of all those negative feelings in all aspects of your life with this brilliant method!
"Whenever you get into a position that you are feeling anxious or scared, use the techniques in this method to find peace and get back into the moment."
This easy system has a way of removing any negative thought that pops into your head so you can be 100% present in any situation.
"And that, my girls, makes you 100% sexy!"
"In most cases, the results you will produce with Panic Away will seem nothing short of a miracle."
Let your body say the words for you.
Let your lips and tongue speak about your kissing skills by subtly licking them.
Let the way you move and gently touch parts of your body show that you know things.
We are talking about how to seduce a man here!
A guy can fascinate you with his words making you feel sexual towards him.
This doesnt work so well with guys.
Hes pretty much interested first (and most) in your body.
Acknowledging this without getting upset and using the way you stand and carry yourself to attract him will make you absolutely irresistible.
Talk to any bartender and shell tell you that the guy who talks about how good a tipper he is never leaves a tip!
The guy who talks about sex all the time is no good at it!
That goes for you too.
"Like we said, never blatantly talk about sex with any man you havent already slept with."
Its the sign of an amateur.
Notice that none of this advice on seducing men involves the sexy things you can say to him because you can never seduce him with your words!
Seduction is only about you and your body.
Its a mischievous look.
Its playing peek-a-boo with your menu.
Its slowly touching your neck with your fingertips.
Its the way you move and the unspoken confidence you carry.
"If you really want to get good at seducing men, practice walking around while thinking, I am a sexual prowler."
"It makes us all giggle at first, but really explore how it makes you feel."
Get into the mind of a sexual prowler and then push that energy outward at the target of your beautiful seduction.
ItEUR(TM)s time to get out there and start seducing men!

"The notion of soul mates or asking yourself,  Is he the one has deep roots in every culture."
It does have some serious drawbacks.
"Once you have determined someone to be your soul mate, you have essentially turned them into some kind of emotional messiah."
"Sure there all kinds of perfect men out there who give you almost everything you need, but then why do half of all marriages end in divorce?"
People cloud themselves to all the other character flaws and downfalls their boyfriend has because now he is the perfect soul mate.
"Some women want a relationship so bad, they refuse to rule anyone out."
They get into mediocre relationships and secretly (or openly) yearn for that perfect relationship.
"That magical completion of yin and yang, man and woman fitting perfectly into each others lives."
Is he the one?
He must be hes still here!
The problem here is that even seemingly awesome relationships have difficulties because you are two different people with different desires and goals.
"Once you start thinking your man was pre-destined to be with only you, that part in your brain that tells you to keep your wits about you actually shuts down."
Those things that normally would drive you up the wall about someone are now cute little peculiarities.
Is he the one?
He must be my pet peeves dont bother me anymore!
"Once that magical feeling of new love wears off, so will the cuteness of his quirks."
So how can you determine if he really is the one?
Promise yourself topay attention!
"Yeah, hes smart, cute, and dangerously sexy, but what does he actually do for you?"
"Before we examine this a little closer, stop and ask yourself one question: Do I really have the skills to keep my soulmate?"
Consider checking out the book Rousing the Lion to learn all the super-secret ways to keep a man feeling like a warrior and to always keep your man infatuated with you.
Does his lifestyle and life goals fit in well with your own?
"Sure it's great to have a warm body around, but do you honestly see your lives getting better and better?"
Can you picture great opportunities both separately and together?
"Can he help you achieve your goals both emotionally, spiritually and financially?"
"Sure, love is blind or whatever, but if you even remotely think that it might upset you many years from now that hes a truck diver, hes always been a truck driver, and always will be a truck driver, then perhaps hes not the one."
Its amazing how many women forget this step.
"Sure hes nice to you and he loves you, but does he really respect the things you say or the decisions you make for your life?"
"Its one thing if he makes fun of you for a silly thing youve done, but does he understand why you do what you do and help you out with some great advice?"
Or does he treat you like youre just a dumb girl who he keeps around because youre cute?
All great relationships are based on a mutual respect for each other.
"Make no mistake about the whole equality issue, guys and girls have vast differences in the way they think and what they consider important and what they hold dear, but understanding that you are both different and deciding to celebrate those differences will really help you answer, is he the one?"
"Sure he makes you happy, but why does he make you happy?"
You can even askwhen does he make you happy?
"If he goes out of his way to make you happy and does it all the time, youve got a good man on your hands."
"If he only does it when hes expecting something in return or after hes messed up in some way, your guy might be a little selfish."
Selfish and uncaring people can also get you smitten with them because they come through at the last possible moment.
You start to reward them for pulling rabbits out of a hat only when they really have to.
Then you convince yourself how great they are for mostly not letting you down.
A great guy wont let things get to the point of having to save the relationship.
Theyre always there for you and they rarely apologize because they dont get into situations where they need to.
How does he act when you are in a terrible mood?
Does he do his best to cheer you up and make things right or does he call you a bitch and say something offhand about your period?
Is he the one?
"If he sticks by you even when you are feeling moody and depressed, youve got yourself a winner."
Sometimes you feel that youve met your soulmate right away.
"You, my friend, are in the biggest danger."
"Not stalk and kill you danger, but danger that you arent thinking with all your senses."
Love can be intoxicating (and theres a reason why we shouldnt drive drunk).
Dont love drunk either.
"When you first start feeling love, the brain is flooded with happy chemicals that were entirely necessary a long time ago."
"Back then, you had to become devoted to your caveman so hed stick around and help feed and protect all your dirty little cave babies."
"Given the fact that nowadays, you can take care of your own business, that ultimate chemical devotion is not longer needed."
It still is a pretty incredible feeling though
Really getting to know someone after those first few flushes of love drugs takes some time.
In fact the first group of love drugs starts wearing off between a year and a half and three years.
"Then you either snap out of your chemical induced stupor and see what a jerk he is, or you calmly and quite intelligently start to understand how great your guy truly is."
"Fortunately, if youre asking yourself,  Is he the one, then theres a pretty good chance you got a good one (unless you do it with every guy)."
"As long as you keep your eyes open and never stop listening to your intuition, you can catch and keep this perfect male specimen."
Find out more ways to hold on to him.
"The moment you lie to yourself that something he does didnt happen or doesnt bother you, then you are in danger of falling hard for a guy who doesnt deserve your great love."
Is he the one?
Hes very lucky to be with someone like you.
"If you want to check out your compatibility based on your astrological sign, find out yourastrology compatibility from our friends at Compatible-Astrology.com."
"Lets say, youve gone through all this information and determined, yes!"
"He really is your soulmate, the one, the perfect male specimen."
Your work is far from from done.
Now you have to figure out how to keep him.
"Just because he is and does everything for you that youve ever wanted, doesnt mean hell always feel that way unless you work very hard to keep things awesome."

"A year ago, I briefly dated a guy who said he owned a company, yet when I learned after a couple of months that he was actually just finding side-jobs in a seasonal situation that did not cover him for the year, I realized how financially unstable he was."
"I learned that he had been living that way for a decade, bartering for rent, living without cable, charming people for discounts, etc., despite how smart and capable he was."
He was 40 years old.
"While he says he wouldnt dream of letting a lady pay for him (so we stayed indoors until I became uncomfortably claustrophobic in my own home), how would someone too broke to order a cup of coffee build a future with me?"
"I wondered, if we eventually moved in together, would I be paying all of the bills since I dont believe in bartering and I like a decent place above poverty wages with cable, etc."
?
"I dont need a rich man, but I want one with motivation who pays rent and gets a paycheck like a normal person."
"I believe that couples should help each other through rough spots, but I dont want to be the sole provider on a permanent basis."
I broke it off after a few months.
Heres the dilemma.
"I felt a remarkably soulful and emotional connection with this guy, and I still think about him; he is also a very good person."
"On occasions, he irritated me, but I also felt joy and peace very often when I was with him and a kind of this-is-it feeling like I could spend the rest of my life with him if he had the stability."
We actually spent long weekends together while we dated and shared more than a few intimate stories about our lives and upbringings.
"A year has passed, and he recently contacted me, telling me that he had loved me while we dated."
I believe this is true because he was always very kind and loving to me.
"My heart ached when he told me his feelings, and I find myself battling again between the polar opposites of love and practicality."
"He knows how I feel about his financial instability, and it doesnt look like he is going to change."
"I dont want to hurt him, and I also dont want to put myself in a stupid situation, yet I truly care about him and see what we could have on a deeper level."
Do I go for money or love?
What do you advise about dating a poor guy?
Isnt there something just soulfully amazing about guys who live outside of the maddening world of money?
I remember going on a trip right after college and I met Ben.
He couldnt care less about money and he had this capacity to love better than any man Ive ever found since.
He ended up moving to my town and we got a place together.
Things were amazing until about the second month when he couldnt help pay rent.
It wasnEUR(TM)t a huge deal because I had a great job.
And then the third and fourth months came and went before I finally realized that I was supporting us.
We would spend our nights in each others arms talking about all the amazing things weve discovered in our lives.I had some incredibly deep conversations with Ben.
I really miss those nights.
The problem is that reality always has a way of creeping back in.
"Since he couldnt afford to go out and I wasnt willing to fund our living AND entertainment, we stayed at homea lot."
I was starting to get isolated from my friends and Id always have to make excuses for why we couldnt meet them for dinner or whatever.
I totally lost touch with all the cool things happening throughout my city and I used to be the girl everyone asked when they wanted something fun to do.
But the love we sharedEUR Oh my God!
Oh how I miss how much we loved each other.
He taught me everything I know about opening my heart.
Forced poverty wasnt such a big deal at the time because I was right out of college.
Im a grown woman now and I can say without hesitation that any man that wants to be in my life better have his own life figured out.
He doesnt have to be rich.
"But he better be able to go out and have fun and, at the very least, cover his own bar tab."
"According to Investopedia, The top two are sex and money:"
"In both cases, one member of the group just cant seem to get enough of what he or she views as a scarce commodity."
"However, arguments about money, according to nearly every survey on the topic, generally win out as the top issue."
"In fact, according to a booklet entitled Making Marriage Last, which is published by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, problems relating to financial matters are a major reason why marriages break down."
We had the sex part down so the only other thing to be unhappy with was the money.
"More specifically, MY money and HIS total lack of it."
"Near the end, I couldnt help myself."
"Any time he would complain about not having a real job or any money, I would fly off the handle!"
It seemed to me that a brilliant guy like Ben could easily get a job he loved that hed love to go to everyday should have been a snap.
It wasnEUR(TM)t until much later that I realized I was condemning him for the exact traits that made me fall in love with him in the first place.
"I hate to say it, but his complete disregard for money will turn YOU into a psycho eventually."
"Unless you grew up poor and know how to entertain yourself with nothing, you will eventually snap and now youEUR(TM)re the one who looks like a jerk."
He loves like an angel but he will turn you into a demon if you end up being the sole financial support for both of you.
It would be one thing if he was brilliantly talented at art or music or something that may one day make him famous.
"But without this impossible dream, youre only looking at becoming his mother."
And I totally get it.
"For some of us women, this is our only plan for the future: to find a some dude who will never make us have to think about all of this credit card debt again."
"So its unfair for me to say bail on an amazing love with a penniless cherub, but its pretty much written in the stars how this is going to end anyway."
"There is hope though, girls!"
"If you read any other advice on this website, youll discover that we recommend one book over all the others: Rousing the Lion."
Its like the missing manual on how to inspire a man to be great.
Guys love it when they accomplish something grand and that they did it all for their queen.
Get his book and figure out a way to get this guy excited about his prospects in life.
You might just get to keep your amazing love AND have a guy with financial stability.
Making this choice between money orlove doesnt have to be a choice.
You can have both worlds if you fight for your love and fight for your lover!

Question submitted by Mary from Florida
I have been emailing a shy guy for about a year.
He lives in the United Kingdom.
He has told me many times he is very shy.
I am not shy at all.
"Just recently, he has just asked me to spend Christmas with him in the UK at his expense."
He writes to me that he is very excited about the prospect of me coming for Christmas.
IEUR(TM)m very excited too.
How does an extorvert make an introvert feel comfortable when meeting for the first time?
Does this relationship even have a chance?
I have really enjoyed emailing him this past year.
Help!
What is is about shy guys thats so intriguing?
A shy guy can be a complete mystery.
"On one hand, hes looking over at you, on the other, hes not coming up to talk to you."
It can be very maddening to have a crush on an introvert.
First letEUR(TM)s start with how to get a shy man.
Shyness is a very maddening issue for a lot of people.
"You see someone you like, but feel powerless to go up and speak to them."
What if she shoots me down?
What if she embarrasses me in front of all my friends?
What if she kills me?
"Sure none of these questions are that big a deal or even rational, but this is the world of someone who battles with shyness."
"If you stumbled on to this page because you are the one with a shyness problem, itEUR(TM)s time to get to work on yourself."
There are a couple things you can do right away to conquer this.
The first is a great course called Panic Away.
It helps get rid of all those terrifying feelings you get in social situations.
"This is the best investment you can make on your future, to stop freaking out and get everything you want."
The second thing you should check out is an awesome audio course that uses little games to retrain your mind to feel better with your shyness called Shyness and Social Anxiety.
"If you listen to this audio series, you will end your awkwardness within a few months, thats their guarantee!"
You cant beat that!
So what if youre the one whos into the shy guy and its obvious hes not going to be making any moves any time soon?
"Well, sister, you have to buck up and make the first moves."
Now is not the time for you to be shy either.
"Do you go for what you want, or do you spend the rest of your life waiting?"
The best way to get things moving is to invite him along.
You dont have to make this a date.
Make it something easy and casual.
"Lets say, youre on you way to get coffee or lunch, simply say, Im on my way out."
Come with me.
The trick here is not to ask.
Tell him that hes coming with you.
He might be so shy that hell refuse.
"Offer to pay if you must, but get him in a social situation with you so he can open up."
Do not invite him to something where it will be you and a bunch of friends and him.
This will put him into a much more awkward place than you want him in.
Its best to let him get to know you first before he gets the scrutiny of your people.
A sneakier method to getting that first date with him is to invite yourself along.
"He might talk about something hes about to do and simply say, Really?"
"Id love to come along, it sounds fascinating!"
"Please note that this exploits his fear of being embarrassed, so only use it as a last resort to force him into spending time with you."
"Now we get to your question, Mary."
Can relationships with an intorvert and an extrovert work?
"If the old maxim, opposites attract hold true, then definitely."
There are a few things to consider.
People who have social anxiety prefer to avoid socializing.
"If youre the kind of girl who loves to go out to the clubs and gets energized by large groups of people, then a shy guy will eventually become a burden."
"Having said that, bashful people make great relationship material."
They have a great way of creating a comfy little world where you two are the leading roles.
Its great to feel so loved.
Shy guys also need a little alone time to recharge.
Its important to not spend every moment with them so they have the opportunity to unwind.
"Although you might feel an overwhelming need to spend all your time with him, dont do it."
"He will allow you, but give him the gift of missing you."
Introverts also tend to fall in love much quicker than most people.
"Perhaps he feels lucky to have you or grateful that you let him into your life, but they tend to be really loving people."
"If you have that moving too fast warning light, keep this in mind when he professes his love."
"As will all the dating advice on this site, you have a part in this too."
There are things you can do to keep such a good guy around.
The first step is to beirresistible in everything you do.
"When you can enchant him, love is not too far off."
"We recommend you read the book, Rousing the Lion."
It teaches you how to motivate your man to greatness.
"Although we know for sure that it is impossible to change someone whos not interested in change, this really is the closest you can get."
Remember that hes shy.
There might be social situations where youll get upset at him for acting awkward.
This is bound to happen and it wont get better if your scold him for it.
You can gently guide him towards making his life better.
What if you got one or both of the courses about shyness for him for Christmas?
"Or maybe you just give them to him randomly by saying, I used to be really shy too and this course helped me tremendously."
"For a shy guy, change comes with confidence."
"You can teach and lead him, but try to be subtle."
"You might need to make all of the first moves for in the beginning, but after awhile, he will understand where you are coming from and meet you at your level."
"Good luck with your shy guys out there and for more information, check out, How to get him to ask you out and How to get him to open up with his feelings."

"Question submitted by Heidi O, 57, Atlanta Georgia"
I feel like Im too old to date.
"After 34 years of marriage, things just couldnt go on."
"I prayed for years for the kids to hurry up and grow up and get out of the house so my husband and I could have the sexy lifestyle some of my now-divorced, younger coworkers were having."
My time finally came and he was too busy fishing and puttering to make me feel like a woman again.
I felt like such a jerk when I asked for the divorce a couple years ago.
There wasnt anything really wrong.
It was just boring the life out of me.
"I expected so much more out of my life as a little girl and it was time to get something I wanted instead of catering to the needs of a scatterbrained husband, three great children and eight active little grandchildren."
The separation and divorce took it all out of me.
My husband who had always been a decent (if not absent) man turned vicious and resentful.
"Hed say, Youre too old to date!"
What are you gonna do?
Be a whore in Las Vegas?
No one will want your wrinkled old body with the eyes of a madman.
He actually made it quite easy to leave him.
It was my children also telling me I was too old to date that really took it out of me.
"I figured my daughter (who also got divorced from a very boring man) would understand how I felt, but when she asked, Mom, what are you doing?"
Dad loves you and it will be so hard to find someone to love at your age.
Its too late to start over.
I started to wonder if I had made a mistake.
"Of everything that I expected to happen, only one came true: now Im divorced."
Ive been single for about a year now and Im starting to believe everyone was right.
I cant seem to find any good guys.
All the weight I lost is creeping back.
My kids are still hurt that I did this and dont bring the grandkids around anymore.
Am I really too old to date?
How can I find a man my age with the same interests as me?
Are there any older men interested in this old hag?
"If what you say is true, then you must be the only single fifty something person in the world and every other old guy is either still married or sitting behind a massive model train set happy as a clam."
Wrong!
The reality is that millions of guys are finding themselves in the exact same situation as you and they are also looking to start over.
Youre never too old for dating or for finding the passionate love youve always been looking for.
Why?
Because there are tons of people at every age looking for the exact same thing as you right now.
What we need here is an attitude adjustment.
Anyone telling you that youre too old to date is telling you that for completely selfish reasons.
"Your ex-husband wants to keep his maid, chef, chauffeur, and sex outlet."
Hes terrified that hes become undesirable and probably feels hes way too old to date too.
Your children want to keep their security blanket and that good old reliable mom will always be there.
Your friends are freaking out because your faltering marriage shines a light on how shaky theirs have become.
The reality is that you are pretty fierce!
"You could have lived out the rest of your days in quiet desperation, hating yourself for not making a move."
You were staring at a lifetime of tedious repetition and television and you said Hell no!
"It takes a lot to get away from a situation that wasnt bad, but it wasnt feeding your soul either."
There are a couple places you need to start.
"First of all, there is a great book written for people new to the dating scene again: Getting Naked Again: Dating, Romance, Sex, and Love When YouEUR(TM)ve Been Divorced, Widowed, Dumped, or Distracted  goes through all of the thoughts you are having about being too old to date or too fat to date and that no one wants to date a grandmother and smashes them!"
You will get all the real information and encouragement for you to get out there and find a new love (and lover!
).
Sexy is nothing but a state of mind.
You see examples of this all the time.
"Most people have that one girlfriend who isnt that good looking, but has guys of all ages flocking around her."
What is her secret?
She knows that shes desirable.
She knows that she is sexy and men loooove confidence.
We all do!
So your next mandatory reading is How to be Irresistible to Men.
You need to find that hot young girl you were before you got married and had her bored out of you.
Give her a hug.
Tell her you love her and be that woman once again.
Being irresistible to men is more than just your looks.
"Sure, looks get you in the door, but its the woman you are inside that captivates any man."
Youre not too old to date because you have the goods right now that a great guy is seeking.
Theyre not inside your house (not yet anyway)!
You have to get out to find them.
"Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, lets talk about online dating."
Finding love on the internet no longer has the stigma that it used to.
Completely normal people are finding their matches every single day and theyre not getting hacked to bits by maniacs or any other urban legend that youve heard about Internet dating.
Whats even better is that there are more and more websites dedicated to people in your age range (and any age range for that matter) and interests so all the screening is pretty much done for you.
So lets jump right in!
A great site is Senior Love Links.
Its dedicated to singles over 50 so you dont have to feel weird about being the old gal among all the 20 year-olds.
"And since we dont feel youre too old for dating at all, we also recommend Senior Match."
Show your daughter that its never too late to start over by finding a boyfriend whos a decade younger than you!
"The skys the limit, girl!"
But you dont need to stop there.
There are hundreds of Internet dating sites.
Pick out a few and put up a free profile.
Youll never know until you try.
You said that you lost a lot of weight and it's creeping back on.
Get back on track!
The single biggest problem people mention about senior dating is the health of potential mates.
So being fit and looking healthy will really make you stand out among all the other women in your position.
We have found that most men dating in their fifties are usually starting over again too and more serious about finding a vivacious mate and keeping her than ever before.
Showing that youre health conscious and care about your body will help you keep that sexy new guy around.
Take care of your skin with your very own homemade skincare products.Get glowing luminous skin year-round.
And did anyone say stop smoking?
Get a new hairstyle and some sensual new clothes!
Its time to reinvent that wife of a putterer and grandmother of eight into a daring and exciting and gorgeous potential lover.
You can do it.
The first step is respecting yourself.
Now its time to get out and do all those things you always wanted to do.
Where do you find quality men?
Theyre out doing all those things that you find interesting.
Join some groups.
Take a few classes.
Talk to everyone you meet and try to make real connections in every conversation.
Every friend has friends of their own
"The more you do, the more exposure you have to potential mates."
Get passionate about an activity and you already have something to talk about with other enthusiasts.
"If youre really feeling too old to date, create a new lifestyle and youll never think that way again."
"And yes, you must show a guy you are interested in him."
Humans love when things are easy.
We tend to go for the mate that shows us the most attention.
"It sounds like your previous marriage was OK, but affectionless."
Its time to get back into the mindset that youre not too old for dating and you want to love like a teenager.
YouEUR(TM)ve got to give to get.
That is a scary idea when you think about it.
You have to open up your heart and be vulnerable to find yourself some love.
You might get crushed!
Look at it this way: would you rather get trampled by love a few times in your quest to find great love or still wake up every day with the same guy who called you a Vegas whore?
Be open to letting go and you will be much more likely to get the relationship that you always deserved rather than the safest one.
"When you approach this as a chore that you want to get over with as soon as possible, you will never find what you are looking for."
Have fun!
Play!
Learn about yourself and discover how different men can romance you.
Youre starting from scratch so develop a curiosity about everything.
Men love a woman who is ready to go.
She is excited about new experiences and brings him out of his shell.
The fact is that no one is too old to date.
We all have a built in desire for love and that never changes no matter how old we get.
"And if you really need some empowerment, check out one of our favorites sites on this subject, Hot Cougar Women!"
ItEUR(TM)s a place for women to celebrate their age (and teaches you how to get closer to some hot younger men who are dying to meet you.
