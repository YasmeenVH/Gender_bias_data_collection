"I think our number one goal in raising children is to provide safety, security, and unconditional love."
I think the nerve hit is defensive daughters.
"I think understanding the context of how we communicate our love to our kids is extremely important, because it gives us room to learn new skill sets if we lack them."
I thought she was doing this to catch my attention.
"I was able to calm her down, and stepped up and made a clear decision based on what I felt my father would have wanted."
I was probably being naive to think my sister and I could just have a normal holiday with our mother.
I watched her carefully and noticed that she was struggling with the old hoover as she pushed and pulled it around the living room.
I'll do a blow post about teasing some time this Fall.
I'm in the challenging situation of being an influence to two late teens who have an abusive mother - I am their Dad's partner after he escaped the abuse.
"I'm not sure the Critic will ever morph into the Wise Woman but if her intentions are purer than her words and gestures would indicate, talking it through will definitely help."

"I'm speaking as a layperson, of course, but one who has interviewed many women, Whether it's possible to do without physical and emotional distance, alas, isn't entirely up to you but up to your mother and whether she's able to listen to you."
I've been on all sides of this equation and I can recognize you all a mile away.
"I've lived this from every angle and every different scenario for the past 40 years, as the daughter, mother, step-mother, etc..."
I've observed the phenomenon you describe at my son's day care centres and summer camps.
"If a new boy came along, all he had to do was start building with blocks or Legs next to the older boys, and in no time, he was an integral part of the group."
"If any of this seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry, you have plenty of time and plenty of room for making mistakes."

"If boys can carry the seeds of marital disruption into the next generation, girls suffer consequences of parental marital distress here and now."
"If close, the relationship can simulate friendship through the familiar characteristics of empathy, listening, loyalty, and caring."
"If he can, you're on solid ground."
"If her daughter ignores her texts or calls, shell call around to her daughters friends and maybe even land on her kids doorstep."
"If I had dared to show her compassion she would have ripped every nerve from my body, metaphorically."
If I love my wife and want to see her flourish then the less time she spends on household chores and the more on personal interests the better; so how about a Room robot vacuum.
"If mother is jealous of the relationship the daughter has with the father, what does the daughter do?"
"If other kids ask, Is that your girl friend?, your child could say, No, she's my pal or She's a friend who happens to be a girl. "
"If power is for sale, sell your mother to buy it."
"If she's motivated by getting an edge over you, feeling superior, it will be hard because she's going to be reluctant to admit to that, On the other hand, if she's pretty much critical of everyone and everything, you can talk to her about how listening to her criticism makes you feel."
"If the daughter does not respond with the expected level of gratitude the mother will use guilt tripping comments such as 'I did something nice for you, why can't you just be grateful?' instead of acknowledging that they made the choice requested."
"If the father is committed to win at all costs, when he wins, he risks losing on two counts."
"If the father is the offender and the mother becomes jealous of the father-daughter relationship, then she too becomes an offender and she cannot put the daughter first."
"If there is a break in the friendship, you want to make sure your child has other social options."
"If they giggle and chant about sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G, your child can just roll her eyes and say ""Grow up!"" in a bored tone of voice."
"If they have internalized the not good enough feeling, they don't see themselves as someone anyone would envy."
"If this advice were given to a woman in an abusive marriage, the author would be declared a misogynist and have their licence reviewed."
"If this is you and you were raised by narcissistic parents, learning how to cope is a must and part of your own recovery."

"If you do not receive the engagement or answers that you were hoping for during the first conversation, give your son time and space to reflect on the conversation before you bring it up again."
If you don't act holy you don't automatically get the title of being holy.
"If you need to address your sons perpetually messy room, don't just talk about the fact that he never puts his clothes in the hamper."
"If you need to withdraw, let him (and the rest of your family) know what is going on - that I'm okay and it's not about you, I just need to sort some things out and think about them by myself."
"If you tend to be this type of guy, be sensitive to the fact that your son may not understand what you are doing."
"If you're always and only the drill sergeant, your sons wind up seeing you as only that - tough, rigid, intimidating."

"In fact, one study found that 80% of boys were indistinguishable from 80% of girls in their amount of rough play."
"In fact, teen daughter Elite states emphatically, In a culture where mom-bashing seems to slip off the tongue and flow through the halls of middle-school, it can seem bizarre to try to talk or even think with compassion about our mothers."
"In fact, the students e-mailed their professor after the semester to tell him that they found his father engaging and intelligent they had learned a lot from him."
In graduate school I encountered the largest sample of beautiful women I have ever seen.
In many situations it is important to confirm that you are on his side and that you trust him.
"In most cases, the daughter is very ambivalent."
"In most incest cases we have worked with, when the father is the offender, this is not the case."
"In my sequel, Little Siddhartha, I imagine the son of Siddhartha becoming a rich and successful entrepreneur, who then has a son of his own, Ra hula, who disappoints his father by treading a spiritual path."
"In other situations, you might want to tap into his competitive side if you feel he will respond well to a challenge you've presented."
"In other words, because physically attractive men and women are (on average) of higher socio-economic status, partner matching on  attractiveness would create a positive correlation between women physical attractiveness and men socio-economic status, and between men attractiveness and women status, even in the absence of any beauty-SES exchange."
"In popular culture, such women are often referred to as trophy wives."
"In review of the literature and other writers on this subject, many say that mother-daughter jealousy is often misinterpreted or not really that common."
"In single parent families just knowing these gender-based differences, can help us alter, adapt, and learn ways to use both masculine and feminine language skills so our kids can still grow up well-adjusted and well-rounded."
"In single parent mothering, even the absent father can exert power when the difficulties encountered in parenting are solely the mother's to sort through, with no societal supports."

"In the era of Goggle and Couture, you can learn practically anything on your own."
"In this process of paternal downsizing, a father can help by admitting mistakes, apologizing for wrong doing, declaring his limitations and ignorance, and even putting his own efforts down in a humorous way."

"Instead, just focus on everyday-integrity - do what you say and believe."
"Instead, she sees her daughter like the other woman, going after her husband."
"Instead, they believe that they have yet again done something wrong."
"Ironically, if Peg knew anything about attachment theory she would know that the hostility is always directed at the good parent or the one in which the child has the secure attachment."
Is every problem really a mother's fault?
Is it at all possible to built an adult life for oneself without having to put a significant distance (physical and emotional) between oneself and the family?
"Is it really, like mother, like daughter?"
"Is it true, that mothers act as role models when it comes to daughters perception of their own body?"
"Isn't that the very notion you criticized in 'The Sheriff?'  Most mothers have parented in thoughtful response (whether similarly or differently) to their own mothers' parenting style, and still somehow end up carrying the full burden when adult daughters are disgruntled."
It can be a hard for some fathers to adjust to the reversal of terms that needs to take place after a son turns adolescent (usually starting around ages 9 - 13) if they are to stay well connected during the remaining teenage years.
"It can be really hard work to contain a teenager in these ways, but if we remember that we are the adult in the relationship, and that they need us to remain steady, this can fortify us."
It creates hurdles to healthy development and the building of sense of self.
It distinguishes between normal tension and toxicity.
"It has become a truism that our spouses can turn out to be strangers after long periods of marriage, but the temptation remains to think that we have our fathers all figured out."
It is a mark of a wise woman that she can accept the care of her daughters when she needs it without either demanding it or resenting it.
It is ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING how much denial these mothers go through.
It is critical the adult child recognize this insecure attachment coming from the parents boundedness and detach from it.
It is further complicated by sibling rivalry amongst my sisters who place great importance on respecting mother while ignoring the fact she is always jealous of me.
It is painful to realize your mother never loved you but it helps if you understand neither was she.
It is terrifying for the child at any age.
It makes no sense to the daughter that her own mother would have these bad feelings about her.
It may be hard for a daughter to bring the Girlfriend to the table to sort things out because this mom likes things the way they were.
It says that she is hurt to her core.
It says that that wound runs very deep.
It seems an unfair burden to place on our sons that they should achieve something we did not.
It seems that there is good evidence for the modelling behaviour hypothesis.
It took counselling to realize that my mom was making choices and that I am not responsible for those choices.
"It will surprise no one that, in the main, the daughters had achieved higher levels of education and career success."
It's a contest firmly anchored in the male performance ethic as each refuses to back down.
It's a relationship that is not replaceable by any other.
"It's an easy line to cross; after all, every woman wants another friend---and mom, especially, want to connect with their teens and teens and not be thought of as old hags."
"It's certainly easier for boys and girls to connect through gender-neutral activities, such as Legs, sports, or hide and seek."
It's different with boys.
"It's important we get it right - not so much for the mothers, but for the daughters."
It's just frustrating and I felt the need to vent this somewhere!
"It's not just mothers that can be toxic, so can daughters."
It's not that men can't be supportive'
It's not the quantity that's important but the quality - it needs to be dedicated solely to him.
"It's possible, she says, that men get better at supporting their partners with practice."
It's really the only thing that you truly can control and give.
It's so important to identify where the toxic is coming from and it's not always the mother.
It's that they are doing it at the wrong time.' Perhaps some men wait until they are certain their wives are really upset.
It's the relationship that's most at risk.
"It's this impression that will be imprinted on them, and which they are likely to pass along to their own sons."
"Its important to understand that the poisonous, corrosive envy felt by narcissistic mothers is not normal."
Its kind of like leaving an open catalogue on the kitchen table with items circled in red marker.
"Jeff tells her study, using diaries of marital interaction and reported stress levels, doesn't pinpoint how men are lacking during tough times, just that women say they are."
John Bond | http://www.lighthouselandscape.com/snow_management.html
"Just as you want your sons to see the complexity that is you, it's helpful for you to move beyond the one-dimensional view of your father that you probably walked out of your childhood with."
"Lately, she has been vacuuming while I am watching football games."
Learning to view their mom as their ally not their enemy is key to peace and definitely possible.
Let him know how proud you are of him - not for scoring the goal in the game - but for who he is.
Let me give an example that illustrates why a wife bonus might undermine a true secure-functioning relationship.
Let them spend the rest of their day pouting... And then they'll probably passive aggressively call their daughters and try to bait them into a fight saying 'you won't believe what I just read....
Life was good and getting better.
Life was good and life together was better.
"Likewise, as parents increasingly have a presence on social networking sites like Casebook, I think we will see how well we are doing as a society of parenting our children and instilling social emotional intelligence, along with the values of grace, humility, humbleness and honesty."
"Likewise, the people on the cruise found his father charming despite his rough ways and poor table manners."
"Little attention is paid to a second, even more difficult transition: When the daughter becomes an adult."
Look back at advertisements in newspapers and magazines at the turn of the last century.
Looks like you hit a nerve with some defensive mama's.
"Lots of mommy attachment issues represented in these lovely films, but with much more fulfilling outcomes."
Make sure he's had something to eat before you start talking.
"Mann, It's estimated that 50-60 percent of children have their emotional needs met in childhood, producing individuals with secure attachment who function well in the world, are able to form intimate connections, recover well from setbacks."
"Many boys can take hours, days, and even weeks to process the substance of an important conversation."
"Many factors such as autonomy, self-esteem and a sense of ones own identity influences the daughters' relationship to food intake and evaluation of their body (Row, Eric, & Seller, 2001; Often, 1999)."
"Many kids, and especially teenage boys, will be more open to talk with less direct eye contact."
Many of the elite now turn to companies like A Foreign Affair to help them find Asian Trophy Wives.
"Many psychologists have found that daughters of mothers with anorexia are often also diagnosed with an eating disorder later in life (Hall & Brown, 1983; Eras et al., 2012)."
Many researchers chalk this sex difference up to women's natural tendency to nurture.
"Mark Twain said, 'When I was a boy (girl) of 14, my father (mother) was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man (woman) around."
"Maybe people didn't ask if you were OK, or hurting at all because you hid it well or because they didn't want to incur the wrath of your abuser (whose abusive character you, the child, may later have discovered was WELL KNOWN by those who COULD have stepped in to help but were afraid to do so, because they feared being on the left hand of the devil that abused YOU) by questioning their behaviour, their handling of situations, or their clear and all too apparent irrational hatred and OBVIOUS envy of their own child!"
"Measuring their achievements against those of their daughters, 65 percent reported their daughters had done more, 23 percent said they had done equally well as their offspring, and 12 percent rated themselves as more successful."
Men are often assumed to be more competent than women at a broad array of unrelated tasks.
"Men go into their cave and, well, mull, for what can seem like a long time."
Men say the same thing about themselves.
"Mendelssohn father regretted stopping high school Latin before reading Virgil Aeneid, sweetly telling his son You can read it for me."
"Mendelssohn father was a mathematician, though, and he often expressed disappointment at his sons lack of mathematical ability."
"Mendelssohn father was not particularly open with his son, but even when fathers are open and honest they still keep secrets."
"Mendelssohn had thought that much of his fathers inward disposition resulted from growing up in a small flat, but after his fathers death an uncle revealed that such was not the case."
"Mendelssohn observed his father interacting with his students and was embarrassed, thinking that the students found the old man to be nothing but a cranky distraction."
"Mendelssohn reflections show that our fathers are not open books, nor are they to be interpreted simply as we please."
"Mendelssohn says, A father makes his son out of his flesh and out of his mind and then shapes him with his ambitions and dreams, with his cruelties and failures, too."
"Mom Six says, Teen mood swings and ambivalent feelings make it challenging for us mothers to remember that our teenage daughters crave our everyday guidance and loving support in their lives."
"Mom, it doesn't matter that you hate bare walls and floors; they're hers."
"Mommy will either blame the child for her anger (even if the child isn't truly the cause or the inspiration) OR mommy will say that mommy isn't mad AT the child, but mad at someone or something else."
"Money can always be lost, but time is lost only if you let it."
More complicating is the question of what the father does?
"More provocatively, a 2004 study by Deborah Carr examined the relationships between mothers who came of age in the 1950s and their daughter who reached adulthood in the 1970s."
"Most children want to please their parents so if given this mixed message, it is easier and perhaps even safer to do nothing and therefore not expose oneself to criticism."
Mothering & Scattering sprung from the Reynolds workshops for mothers and their 10-15 year-old daughters over the last seven years.
"Mothers and daughters have always shared the common experience of being home-makers, responsible for maintaining and passing on family values, traditions, and rituals."
"Mothers and Daughters in Conversation, Deborah Tanned writes that, Women are healed by, or ache for, satisfying conversations with their mothers and adult daughters; in some cases, to build on already excellent relationships, in others to break out of cycles of misunderstanding that can turn amiable conversations into painful or angry ones in the blink of an eye."
Mothers are often reaching menopause when their young daughters are developing into beautiful young women and some say that it may be normal for mothers to have some touchy feelings about ageing.
Mothers as Role Models
Mothers can really suck.
"Mothers constantly check their children weight, observe if they gained too much weight and have a desire for their child to be skinny."
"Mothers may find themselves caught in this relational shift at the same moment that they actively return to their own roles as daughters, caring for their ageing mothers and fathers."
"Mothers never stop being mothers, which includes frequently wanting to protect their daughters and often feeling responsible for their happiness."
Mothers who believe that they cannot control their daughters behaviour often raise daughters who restrict their diet.
"Much like Mendelssohn father, all fathers have regrets about their own lives, paths not taken and dreams not achieved."
"Much still remains hidden, though, and much may be obscured when the father thinks that his own experience is an objective lens through which to see his sons experience."
Mum has been a tower of strength as I've wrestled with the crazy making family court issues and tried to figure out how to nurture two very wounded young women.
"My advice to husbands: If you want to lead a happy life, buy your wife a hoover for Christmas."
My daughter attacks me and is passively aggressive whenever we speak...or else she's as sweet as can be.
My goal as a parent is to raise capable independent adults that don't 'need' me.
My grown son was with me at the hospital when my father was on life-support.
"My Mum has learned to be a balanced, warm source of care and wise words to all her daughters and she's a terrific role model as my sisters and SIL address their roles as mothers of adult children."
My partner's daughters get verbal abuse for wanting a relationship with their father.
My step dad's brother lives with us and he is 30 now.
My stepmother was understandably over-wrought about what to do next.
"Nestled under Christmas trees were electric toasters, coffee percolators, and, yes, a hoover."
No mother deserves that sort of visceral hatred.
None of which have the slightest shred of truth in them.
Normal or healthier mothers are proud of their children and want them to shine.
"Not every Sheriff mother is pure of heart, though; some enjoy making their daughters feel inadequate, and crossover into Critic territory."
"Not everything you say will stick - he may have no interest in cars, soccer not basketball may be his thing - but that's not the point."
"Not just intergenerationally speaking, but also regarding how men and women raise their children."
"Not that she doesn't try anyway, but it cuts down on the unwanted advice and contention significantly."
"Not that they don't care deeply about their mothers, it's just that they shouldn't be burdened with their mother's well being."
Now fishing seems boring compared to skateboarding which is exciting.
Now he finds grounds -- frailties and flaws and failings in his father-- to help diminish the man.
Now he's into activities that don't interest me so we don't have good ways to be together any more.' This disconnection doesn't have to necessarily be so.
"Now that he's a teenager he doesn't want to do the father/son stuff we used to do with each other any more,' explains the man, saddened by the loss of companionship with his old buddy."
"Now their traditional roles are reversed, as he becomes the student and his son the teacher, the young man feeling respected in this new instructional role."
"Now what matters most to the man is asserting his authority, proving that he is in charge, that he knows best, dominating at all costs, and getting his way."
Obviously no two fathers are alike - their style is a blend of their unique personalities and strengths - but good fathers do have certain traits in common.
Of course the ultimate outcome is always the same.
"Of course, children need to have healthy relationships with both parents."
"Of course, much of what I have written here can be applied to mothers and daughters, mothers and sons, fathers and daughters."
"Of course, we may think we know them as others do if we have the opportunity to see them interacting with friends, relatives, co-workers, and strangers."
Often men in relationship with female narcissists choose to cater to the mother to maintain the adult relationship.
"Often these friendships come about because the kids are neighbours, or their siblings are friends, or the families enjoy spending time together."
"Often, the Absentee is married to someone other than the daughters father or has other children she is more invested in."
"Oh well, I've meandered so much that I've forgotten where I meandered from."
"On the other hand, research (and practical experience) tells us that kids who respond to teasing with big emotional reactions tend to get teased more."
One example is when parents go through the daughters personal stuff even when asked not to do so (see Tip 1).
"One example of this is, when daughters think it is very important that they live up to their mothers expectations."
"One group assumes that mothers act as role models for their daughters, while the other group of scientists assumes this relationship to be interactive; where mothers either facilitate or protect daughters from concerns about weight and shape."
"One in five adult children are back in their childhood bedrooms and, even if they aren't, many of them are receiving some form of financial support from their mothers, fathers, or both."
One line of research focuses on mothers as a role models for their daughters when it comes to evaluating one's body.
One reason for this separation is that boys and girls tend to play in different ways.
One theme was that of mothers being jealous of their daughters.
Only loving husbands would be thoughtful enough to give their wives the gift of time.
"OR if you see or sense sadness (or what you PERCEIVE to be sadness) in another, you--in your hyper care towards the feelings of others--will 'over ask' if they are 'OK,' of if something is wrong, or if they are sad, or if they are hurting, or if they need to talk."
Or make efforts not to repeat that behaviour?
Or maybe some newly married men are just inexperienced.
"Or suppose the son who grew up a fan of his father's Country music now comes to love Hip Hop instead, a more percussive kind of sound not suited to his father's taste."
"Others in this child's life will EASILY spot this problem, will probably TELL said child what they see (the child being abused by friends or significant others), the child will agree with the one that cared to reveal, BUT the child WILL, most likely, go back to those that treat them like rubbish."
"Our fathers and forefathers deserve our respect for the hardships they endured and the feats they accomplished, but we need not see ourselves as less."
"Our fathers remain a mystery, concealing hidden passageways."
Over-sharing is her trademark and has been since her daughter was in her teens.
"Overall, women and adolescent girls are 2 1/2 times more likely than men and adolescent boys to be taking one of the pills."
"Parent lectures are easy for kids to ignore, but good questions help them think."
Parenting is a road to planned obsolescence.
Parents also discourage communication with the opposite sex.
Parents are responsible for their children until adulthood by your own admission.
"Part of the imbalance, says Jeff, is that wives may not communicate their needs directly to their husbands."
Perhaps the reason for America's high divorce rate lies within this contemporary paradigm: a modern woman's stressful existence and a man's inadequate response.
Placing responsibility for adult maladjustment squarely on the shoulders of women who went through hell and high water to do right by their children is a perpetuation of gender bias - that which has made it impossible for women to advance images of competence in the social or economic system.
Playing separately maintains and increases differences in how boys and girls interact.
Please keep in mind that I speak as a layperson since I'm neither a psychologist nor a therapist.
"Plus the image of the urban sport, and how he dresses for it, has a renegade appeal."
Power struggles are another matter.
Power tests of skills provide for safe competition; power struggles for control risk extreme measures that can result in injury.
"Previous research suggests that spouses, especially women, have roundabout ways of telling their partners that they need extra care and encouragement."
Providing physical and ideally tangible examples will help your son process and remember your conversation.
"Psychologist have found (Row, Eric, & Seller, 2001) that anorectic daughters often complain that they have to act as the parent in the relationship (see Tip 2)."
"Psychologists assume that when mothers are happy with their own body and eat normally without over thinking it, they in turn teach their daughter to love and accept their own body."
Psychologists consider an interactive relationship of the influence of mothers in the daughters' development of eating disorders where many variables can influence this process.
"Rather, the mother daughter relationship is interactive in which it either protects or facilitates weight and shape concerns of the daughter."
"Redefining the mother-adult daughter relationship, even when the bond is strong and constant, is an absolute necessity, but this connection has a good shot at peaceful resolution."
Rephrasing a daughters' behaviour within the greater context of her own growing up is central to diffusing conflict.
"Research shows the tension between mothers and adult daughters is more of the norm than not, even in essentially loving relationships."
Seventy percent were employed at age 35.
She also encourages mom to embrace mothering as a kind of martial arts dance.
"She always said, If you love me, you will know what I want for my birthday and for Christmas."
"She definitely does not know how to deal with the fact that we are both adults, especially with my sister having her own family now and me trying to assemble some kind of social life."
She doesn't get why I would find having plans like that important.
"She enjoyed what she did to me and was open about it, taunted me with her lack of love for me, and even went so far as to brag about it."
She expected the women to ascribe their daughters' success to social changes in the 1960s and 1970s.
"She feels unloved and as Mother Theresa so aptly writes, the most terrible poverty is loneliness, and the feeling of being unloved."
She has a very specific sense of what should or ought to be done in every circumstance and on every occasion.
"She is aware of the need to pay attention to the comments she should have kept to herself, the moments at which she invaded her daughters space."
She is really controlling but now at 27 years old I am making progress in my career but she almost ruined me I survived.
She likes to trap herself in this little bubble of misery which I don't know why it even shocks us any more because this isn't the first time she's got unjustifiably upset at us not calling her every single day.
She likes to use the fact that we might not call every single day against us to accuse us that we don't care about her at all.
She may feel intensely competitive with her daughter and feel undone by her daughters successes.
"She relished that same silence and compliance as validation, not realizing that they were willing to sacrifice me to keep her malignancy from focusing on them."
"She should not restrict and control her daughters eating too much, nor should she give her daughters the feeling that their mothers love depends on how much she weighs."
She usually buys everything else on her own so I buy her hobby things.
She wanted to be young and irresponsible and wanted to stay that way after her daughter was born.
She wants both of her parents to love her.
"She works on learning how to master this relational shift and she does her best to try to see it from her daughters point of view, although not always with success."
"She's been a helicopter parent from day one making sure that her daughter always has the home court advantage, helping with homework, finagling whatever needs doing and the problem is that now that her daughter is an adult, she's out of a job unless she insinuates herself into her daughters life big time."
"She's nosy and intrusive and when her daughter starts putting up fences, she either begs and pleads or hits the roof."
"She's proud of her mom, on the one hand, and is pleased to note the ways in which she and her mother are alike; on the other hand, she also feels the need to differentiate herself from the mighty Oak and find an arena which is hers alone in which she can distinguish herself."
"She's quick to share her opinions (she's positive that they are the right ones, after all) without being asked on everything from the chopping of cherry tomatoes in a salad (Yes), whether the ceiling of a room should be wallpapered (Always), along with what she considers an encyclopaedic knowledge of raising children (If a child isn't potty-trained by two, the mother has done a lousy job)."
Sheriff mothers don't just drive their daughters crazy but tend to alienate their daughters spouses too.
"Should the father do so, the young man may pay a high price for independence: 'My father treated me as a failure as a son for not succeeding to be a man like him.' This is why the son needs the father's blessing: 'I love and respect the man you have chosen to become.'"
"Show him how to tie a tie, educate him about relationships with women, help him understand the focus and value of work."
"Siddhartha may have understood his son well, but it would be a mistake to believe he understood his son fully."
"Siddhartha sees his own pride and arrogance in the boy, and he wants to protect his son from making the same mistakes he did as a young man."
"Siddharthas beloved son had left him, much as he had left his own father decades before."
Siddharthas father knew that he could keep his son in body but not in mind.
"Siddharthas father must have longed for his lost son all those many years, but Siddhartha gave his father no thought until he was a father himself and caught sight of his own reflection in a river."
"Similarly, a daughter may feel ambivalent about how involved she wants her mother to be as she makes the first decisions of her adult life; she may simultaneously want maternal support, on the one hand, and unfettered independence, on the other."
"Similarly, the daughter may need the Oaks praise more than she needs what the Oak believes is her unvarnished opinion about her children choices."
"Since I'm neither a therapist nor a psychologist, I've drawn on my own experience as the mother of an adult daughter and the many interviews I've conducted over the years."
"Sits daughter, Elite, continues the mother-daughter discussion in'Scattering': 6 Keys to Stronger Mother-Teen Bonds."
"Six and Elite emphasize to mothers that even though it can be tempting to act like your daughters best friend, teenage daughters need to be kept in a safe container."
"Six explains, As our daughters mother, we can contain her by not reacting to her moody behaviour, by holding the line at rude behaviour, and by waiting until she calms down before we discuss the issues at hand."
Skip the speeches or lectures.
"So go beyond How's work, how's the car, how's the weather talk, and ask your father about his past struggles, present fears, his life-long passions to shake up your old assumptions and discover what made him tick."
So here it is.
"So many mom spoke to us about how happy they are to be finished with the 'eye rolling' and look from their adolescent daughters, a look that says, 'You must come from a different evolutionary chain than me.' Daughters also adopted the famous Mark Twain quote about ageing, with some slight alterations, and their feelings about their mothers."
So much so that I included it in what I call the Ten Stingers of mother-daughter dynamics when the mother has a high level of narcissistic traits.
So now we were supposed to go see her tomorrow and that's probably not going to happen.
So that leaves a father unable to connect with his daughter and of course this leaves the daughter with a lack of emotional connection with both parents.
So the man profits from disagreement by learning more about his son from the exchange.
"So yeah sure, she may ask to my sister for example, what should I feed [my nephew] when her plan is really just to give him whatever she thinks is best or do things the way she wants."
"So, when you felt guilty about 'going astray' as a mother, did you perchance apologize to you daughter?"
"So, yes, I think it does often help to teach children a boring response to ordinary teasing, so they know something to do or say other than crying or screaming."
"Some Fixers mean well but they just can't accept that they've been sidelined, and that's not okay."
"Some of these roles blend into each other, and there's a wide spectrum of behaviours connected to each one."
Some people are actually obtuse enough and unaware enough not to recognize the impact of their words and gestures.
"Some researchers (Sadeh-Sharvit et al., 2015) wanted to know how daughters abnormal relationship with food develops."
Some say it is even normal at some level.
Some tension stems from the primacy each part of the dyad gives to the relationship.
"Somehow, some way, he must cut his father down to human size, but in doing so he loses his ideal, even growing angry at his father for the loss."
Sometimes it feels like were supposed to not get along with them.
Sorry some mothers do deserve that kind hatred.
"Stanley Greenspan, the famous child psychiatrist and paediatrician, urged parents to do what he called 'Floor Time:' Dedicate a certain amount of time every day - half hour, hour, 15 minutes - for 1:1 time with your son and let him decide what you will both do together."
"Staring down into your sons eyes while having an important conversation might be interpreted as aggressive or unnerving, and your son might shut down as a result."
"Still, science has yet to determine other influential factors."
"Studies also show that women are more empathetic and better at reading non-verbal emotions than are men, which may account for speedier female reactions."
"Such reverence for the older generation is certainly misplaced, though."
"Sure, you have standards that you want your son to reach, but he'll only get there if you can encourage him with plenty of praise and positives."
Taking all this information into account we learn that Emily does not need to worry about her daughter simply copying her behaviour.
"Talk, even if he is at first silent."
Teach guy stuff.
"Teach him how to stand up and be assertive about things that he feels are important, about how to recover when you've been discouraged or defeated, or how to take action and solve a problem when you feel emotionally overwhelmed."
"Teach your son about your passions -- cars, clothes, the zone defence."
"Teenage daughters are resistant, for sure, but they don't have to be."
Tell him ahead of time about the timing and topic you want to discuss with him.
"Tell him stories about times when you struggled, when you had doubts, when you did something courageous."
"Telling your son that you are sorry you over-reacted, that you didn't mean to hurt his feelings, that you made a mistake goes a long way in not only repairing the relationship, but in teaching him an invaluable lesson about responsibility and humility."
That bitch can find someone else to bully and micromanage the hell out of.
That leaves something like 40-50% of children whose emotional needs are not met by their primary caretaker.
That's because fathers transfer disappointment in a marriage onto a female child.
That's what tends to happen in neighbourhoods or family gatherings.
That's where what I call the mothering-as-a-martial-art-dance comes in handy.
"The adolescent girls had already established their play groups, their friendships and their social hierarchies, and it wasn't easy for a new girl to join them."
The artistic mother do sent change .
"The book details the seminar and the cruise that father and son took afterwards, retracing The Odyssey."
The bottom line is this: the relationship between adult daughters and their mothers is an area that demands more attention than the culture has given it.
The challenge for daughters of narcissistic mothers is to learn how to recognize and cope with abnormal maternal envy.
The child attacks the parent with whom they have the most secure attachment and idolizes the parent that they have the insecure attachment/bond to.
"The child son wants to glorify the man, but when he does, come time for adolescence, his dad has become such a hero figure there is no way the teenager can measure up to the exemplar he has worshipfully created."
"The common adage is that Mom may make the rules, but Dads enforce them."
The connection between beauty and socio-economic position:
"The critics motivations are various; under the guise of helpfulness, she finds a way to insinuate herself into her daughters life at the very time the daughter is establishing her independence."
The cultural mythologies about mothering as instinctual as well as our ideas about filial duty muddy the waters and stop us from talking about these tensions frankly.
"The cultural myths about motherhood deprive this role of discussion and publicity, even though Absentee fathers are all over the place."
The culture and schools had a lot to do with that.
The dad is missing the point.
The daughter can be grateful and will seek the mother's help.
The daughter tries her best to make sense of the situation and decides that something must be wrong with her.
The daughter wanted the dresser in one place; the mother put it in another!'
"The daughter, though, feels abandoned and slighted, especially in the early years of adulthood."
"The daughters sense of self is built during the years of her infancy, childhood and adolescence, and highly dependent on her connection to her mother."
The daughters sense of self is cancelled by disdain and criticism.
"The excruciating colonial stereotypes Asian women as submissive, domestic, hyper sexual are obviously nothing new."
"The father knows the son whole, but the son can never know the father (294)."
"The father refuses the request, and the son refuses to disobey."
"The father tells his son that if he discovers the enlightenment he seeks, then he should come back and teach it to his father."
The father was not crowded but mostly alone with his own father gone for weeks at a time for work and his mother working long hours and both brothers usually out of the house.
The Homeric Greeks believed that few sons are the equal of their fathers.
The intimate nature of the relationship between a mother and daughter is sometimes confusing.
"The less satisfying their marriage, the more negative fathers are toward their daughters--who, in turn, are more sissy toward them."
"The message from mom is: if at first you don't succeed, give up!"
"The minutes she saves will allow her to spend more time cleaning clothes, ironing, and washing dishes."
The missionary views their habit of doing things for others (even at their own expense) as proof of how she cares and because being 'nice' is integral to their self-identity.
The most extreme cases of mother-daughter jealousy appear in families where there is incest.
"The most serious father/adolescent son conflicts I see in counselling are when the father pushes his agenda of resemblance ('My way is the right way') so hard that the teenage son feels duty bound to resist ('My life is up to me.') Now the adolescent son will even rebel against self-interest to oppose his father, failing in high school and hurting his future to spite the educational agenda of his father."
"The mother and child relationship is, therefore, more intimate and more intense than any other."
"The mother can be jealous of her daughter for many reasons: her looks, her youth, material possessions, accomplishments, education and even the young girls' relationship with the father."
The mother daughter interaction
The mother takes the side of the child as it should be and leaves the offender.
The mother-daughter relationship was very complex.
The mother/daughter relationship is so much more comprehensive than the best friendship.
The mothering styles you describe are gross generalizations that have about as much to do with attachment security as the Sun being 93M miles away from Earth.
The mothers attributed their daughters' success to education and career planning as well as talent and motivation.
"The Oak casts a long shadow over the sapling, and so the highly accomplished, sometimes witty and social, often beautiful and charming, mother makes it hard for her daughter to find her own place in the sun."
"The Oak needs to recognize the role she plays, even unwittingly, and applaud her daughters efforts to individuate, and refrain from giving unsolicited advice."
The one role not mentioned is the one I've written about before: The unloving or mean mother.
The other direction of research assumes mothers to either facilitate or protect their daughters from weight and shape concerns.
The pain of loss and longing in the scene is nearly unbearable.
"The point is the relationship, taking the time and responsibility for shaping him."
"The Psychologist Dr. Often (1999) has found maternal autonomy, the perception to have control over your daughters actions and activities, to play an important role."
"The quality of that connection over the year sand the degree to which the daughter felt loved, understood, and listened to inform the adult relationship."
"The roles mother play in their adult daughters lives are various and, in an effort to start a discussion, I've given them my own thoroughly unscientific names."
"The same holds true for musical differences that develop as the man listens to songs foreign to his ears, has their appeal patiently explained, and the artists described."
The same is true for mothers with a negative body image.
"The study, My Daughter Has a Career; I Just Raised Babies, used data gathered when the women were ages 18, 36 and 53, plus interviews with 16 mothers at age 59."
The teenager always defeats the parent.
"The things I love to do, that I taught him to enjoy, that we shared in common all those years, they are mostly gone."
The whole situation is crazy-making for the daughters feelings.
The woman portrayed receiving these gifts were wild with excitement.
"Their message is a bit unconventional, but has proven powerful for many of the mother-daughter pairs they've met."
Their mother currently won't accept the younger girl has mental health issues.
Their silence and compliance went as far as her words and actions to convince me that I was worthless.
Then there is father/son competition - power tests (which can be good) and power struggles (which can be bad.)
There are plenty of boisterous girls and gentle boys.
There is a Buddhist saying - How you do anything is how you do everything - and successfully navigating through life is about the how of what you do rather than the what.
There is a joint chapter in the middle.
There is a temptation to think that a father can know his son better than the son can know the father.
"There is an old Chinese proverb that states 'One Generation plants the trees; another gets the shade,' and this is how it should be with mothers and daughters."
There is one type of mother not covered probably because it would be similar to the Fixer but has a couple of distinct traits.
"There's a cultural stereotype that women are more supportive than men,' says Lisa Jeff, a psychologist at the University of Toledo."
"There's also the addition of her self-imposing prisons on herself all of our lives at least first in her marriage and in raising my brother who needed round the clock care and, now that he's in a group home, deciding to be an at-home nurse these past 5 years so she is working there 24/7 and uses it as an excuse to not come and see us and make us come to her (though she could easily ask for a day or two off here or there but doesn't)."
"There's also this generational gap (my mom had us pretty late, so she is 65 while her oldest is about to be 30)."
There's no way you feel that way about me.... Blah blah.' keep up the good work Peg.
"Therefore, just as a father should not discount a teenage daughter for not being similar enough to him, the man should not enforce excessive sex role similarity to him by his son."
These are not the same differences as there were when the daughter was fifteen and the mother in her thirties but they persist because the self and how conflict is resolved continue to change over time.
"These characteristics include a mother's role as primary emotional caretaker, a lack of reciprocity, and a hierarchy of responsibility."
These friendships can provide a very healthy basis for later male-female relationships.
"These habits are primarily shaped by our mothers who control when, where, what and how much we eat."
"These may be interpreted as an attack, which will provoke a fight or flight response especially with a volatile teenage boy."
These results not only show that the mother daughter relationship is more complex when it comes to weight concerns in daughters but also that a lack of independence is a risk factor for eating pathology in young women.
"They also emphasized the downside: In pursuing careers, their daughters had created lives that were more stressful and unhappy than their own."
They also highly control the children food intake.
They are unable to recognize that their help is their choice and unsolicited yet they will continue the behaviour because it is highly ingrained into her self-esteem and self identity.
"They do not necessarily inherit our talents, abilities, and affinities."
They do so by giving their child less time to drink their bottle or they delay the onset of solid food to the children diet.
They focused on aspects of their own lives that made them feel good.
They interviewed a large group of anorectic mothers with babies and toddlers about their feeding behaviour.
"They see apologizes as caving in, you win, I lose."
They usually do not see their own goodness enough to recognize maternal envy for what it is.
"They work out the problem in their heads and eventually come out an issue the punchline - I want to do this, we need to do that - often skipping the back-story, much to the frustration of their partners."
"They're dating a white guy, and they may not know if it's a fetish thing.'"
This advice calls to mind a poignant scene in Hermann Messes Siddhartha in which the title character asks his fathers permission to leave home and abandon his studies as a Brahman to join a group of wandering ascetics.
"This attitude will prevent them from having any healthy, satisfying relationships."
"This division increases over the early school years, and it's a world-wide pattern, found not just in the United States, but also in India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, and the Philippines."
This doesn't mean he has to buy a skateboard too.
This doesn't mean that the mother/daughter relationship can't be very close and satisfying.
"This early implemented and abnormal eating pattern continues into the daughters teenage years (Allen, 2014)."
This goes for most of India.
"This hierarchy, combined with unconditional love, precludes mothers and daughters from being best friends."
"This included several attempts at different hours, on her Skype and her cell phone (at one point we heard her accidentally pick up my sister and hang up)."
This is a great way to support the friendship and not make it seem like dating.
"This is a huge assumption, and you have even declared it rather spitefully."
This is a relationship with a very specific history which sets it apart from all others.
This is a stereotype that is harmful to both boys' and girls' social development.
"This is something some men don't do very well - they can be arrogant, they blame others for their problems and emotions."
"This is what makes children thrive and become well-adjusted adults who are independent, but also see the value of working cooperatively interdependently for the betterment of the community."
This is what you want to teach your son.
"This jealousy is particularly difficult for the daughter as it carries a double-message: Do well so that Mother is proud, but don't do too well or you will outshine her."
"This led them to feel that, in fact, they had enjoyed more success in the domain of family."
"This line definitely struck me from the section about the Fixer: 'If her daughter ignores her texts or calls, shell call around to her daughters friends and maybe even land on her kids doorstep."
This makes sense because the father can know the history of his sons life to an extent that the son cannot know the fathers' life.
"This mother doesn't need much explanation but the bottom line is that, according to her at least, her daughter is always falling short in important ways."
"This mother has been walking through the paces of parenting without enthusiasm for a time and has been waiting for the empty nest with bated breath; the minute her daughter becomes an adult by the families standards (usually post-college), the Absentee is out of the game."
"This mother may be well-meaning and loving in her own way but she has never recognized a single boundary when it comes to her daughter; she may also be enmeshed, especially if the daughter is an only child."
This mother needs to be in the know on everything and has no respect for boundaries.
This relationship was even stronger for mother daughter pairs that are highly dependent on each other (see Tip 4).
"This relationship with the hyper-critical mother is extremely tense, and is maintained by the daughter at personal great cost."
"This role has less to do with how a mother acts than who she is, and the tension often emanates from the daughters side, even though the Oak may contribute from time to time."
"This unique bond doesn't mean that when daughters mature they can't assume more responsibilities and give back to their mothers, but it's never equal and it's not supposed to be."
This was an ingenious and intuitive piece of parenting.
"This was not true of fathers with either sons or daughters, nor was it true for mothers if the successful child were a son."
This will keep your son alert and engaged.
"This would be impossible, though."
"Those are interesting observations, Astoria, and there's some data to back up what you're seeing."
"Though emotionally challenging, this process can help heal old wounds, and allow you to move on to be a father of your own making."
"Through active and passive resistance the son ultimately prevails because in the end, when it comes to adolescent independence, parents never defeat the teenager."
"Throughout our roles, we often felt guilty that we may have gone astray as mothers, and articles such as this one confirm our failures."
"Throw a personality disordered mother and sisters and am, you've got the perfect recipe."
"Thus, when daughters feel like they can't be the child in the relationship and when boundaries between parents and daughters become blurry it puts the child at risk to develop eating disorders."
"To both women, the relationship is central to the sense of self, although in different ways."
"To ensure kids thrive in their lives, I think it is our responsibility to install what unconditional love means in every interaction we have with them."
"To further reduce the discrepancy between them, the son can grow himself in ways his father never did, excelling at what his father did not or cannot do."
To stay connected at this transition it's time for the father to bridge adolescent differences with interest and relate on terms that matter to his teenage son.
"Today contemporary mothers and daughters also share the experience of the workforce, technology and lack of a generation gap, which may bring them even closer together."
"Treat him like you would treat a 10 year old, punish him when he makes mistakes (not too hard), and reward him when he is good."
"Try taking your talk outside, walking around the block, shooting hoops or playing catch while you discuss the issue at hand."
"Two criteria for healthy power tests are that the son gains competence and self-esteem, and the father/son relationship are strengthened from competition that never becomes so serious it ruins the fun of play."
"Two primary reasons were 1) the mothers' attribution of their lack of success to the mores and dictates of the era, the 1950s, in which they came of age and 2) the high costs they saw their daughters paying for their success, including having to deal with the balance of work and family."
"Ultimately, though, all three generations are reunited, much as they are in The Odyssey."
Understand your own father to better understand yourself.
"Unfortunately, women can have diminished control in a solid two-parent household."
Unhappily married mom develop a special emotional synchrony with sons.
"Unlike Homers Odyssey, Messes Siddhartha does not reunite father and son."
"Up to age 7, boys tend to be friends with a few other boys, whereas girls play with a whole group of girls, but after age 7, boys tend to hang out in larger groups whereas girls gravitate towards a few best friends."
"Updating your view of him can help you change your view of yourself, and reduce your fear of making his mistakes."
"Usually, the Absentee has a life philosophy that jibes with her stance, and she's fond of alluding to how she was on her own, made her own way, figured it out by herself and the like."
"Visit any school playground and you'll see it: From about age four onwards, boys mostly play with boys; girls mostly play with girls."
Walk around the room and use physical examples.
Walking side-by-side or driving in a car will naturally lessen the amount of direct eye contact.
We cannot and should not try to make them into new and improved versions of ourselves.
"We do not know our fathers fully even when they have been with us all our lives, even when they have been present emotionally and not just physically."
"We don't deserve the degrading character stereotypes, nor the demand that we all be 'Wise Ones.' Perhaps Psychology Today should stop promoting the idea that a) mother-daughter tension represents maternal pathology rather than a normal part of relationship development and b) daughters are so dependent upon their mothers' mothering that they cannot possibly bear a shred of responsibility for creating or mending problematic interaction."
We have all experienced or observed the correlation between hunger and irritability.
"We know them only as fathers, not as the world knows them."
"We may think we know the reasons why our fathers are the way they are, the environmental forces that shaped them."
"We need to let them be who they are, let them walk their own paths."
We've all heard stories of (and some of us have witnessed up close) mom who are trying so desperately to be cool that they opt for the role of Buffs to their daughters instead of mom.
"Well, our sons can't literally do things for us in that way."
Were these tycoons consciously courting Asian babes?
"What also helps is a realization that she is what she is, she will never change and so I have to adjust my expectations of our relationship."
What changes when married couples are away from the prying eyes of the lab?
What he saw in the reflection was his fathers face.
What makes it worse is that when the mom's actions for others are at their own expense and with the 'lack' of gratitude or reciprocated actions they begin to resent the daughter.
What makes this transition so hard?
"What the Wise Woman knows is that, appearances to the contrary (and it doesn't matter how old the mother and daughter each are), this can never be a relationship of equals."
"What women take from the interaction is the negative,' says Jeff, echoing the famous conclusion by marriage guru John Ottoman that within unhappy relationships, negative behaviour outweighs the positive."
What's the secret to women's superior emotional perception?
"When competition is played out through friendly contests, the boy testing his skill and knowledge against the more experienced and competent man, the outcome can be beneficial to the relationship between boy and man."
"When his son was younger, the little boy wanted to relate on terms that interested his father because being similar to his father created a sense of closeness to the man he wanted to imitate."
"When it comes to dealing with life's everyday hassles, women say they are more responsive to their husbands' stress than vice versa."
"When mothers also believe that their daughter have no control over her actions, then daughters show even worse dietary restrictions and are less satisfied with their body."
"When she envies and then criticizes and devalues the daughter, she diminishes the threat to her own fragile self-esteem."
"When that boy became an adolescent, however, it became time to let go childish things and develop older, alternative interests to claim his individuality and independence."
"When the issue becomes one of control over the son's life, over the choices he makes like friends or school achievement or future direction, the father may pit his way against his son's way."
"When the same children are 4 years old they use chocolate or other candy to sooth their emotions (de Base et al., 2015)."
"When their sons voice negative feelings, the mothers are likely to reciprocate."
"When there is an argument with their partner, they in turn also get angry at their daughters."
"When they tell you they're fine, you MAY not believe them because you ALWAYS told that lie when you were NOT 'OK,' of when YOU were sad, or when YOU were hurting, or of YOU wanted to tell something but decided it bests not to."
"When trying to explain this phenomenon, researchers standpoints divide into two separate corners."
"When we talk about tensions in the mother-daughter relationship, the focus is usually on the period of adolescence, widely seen as the most challenging."
"When you win, we both win,' the man says."
"While in your own mind you're doing what you're doing because you care and are worried, what they see is a guy who is always on their back, always nitpicking, always on edge."
"While it's more typical for children to stick to their own sex when it comes to friendship, many children do have friendships with members of the opposite sex."
"While many people believe that to be envied would be a desirable, powerful experience, in reality being envied, particularly by ones own mother, is unnerving and awful."
"While some adult relationships are still troubled, many finds them to be extremely rewarding."
"While the young girl is growing up she uses her mother as her primary example of how to be a girl, woman, friend, lover, and person in the world."
"While you shouldn't expect him to show up to the conversation with a check list of counter-points, this will give him the necessary time to pre-process the impending conversation and gather any thoughts that he might have."
Who controls their daughters?
Why are the West's most powerful men coupling up with younger Asian women?
Why is the adult daughter-mother relationship often fraught?
"With all the friendships, I had with males when young, not one has had the propensity towards homosexuality."
"With each invention, additional leisure minutes were harvested."
"With each invention, people labour less and consequently have more leisure time."
"With each minute saved, both men and women rejoiced because they could spend more time with their families and on their individual pursuits."
"With rare exceptions, boys had ZERO interest in playing princess  games, but most were happy to welcome girls who liked Legs and Hot Wheels."
"With that being said it is increasingly important that as we interact with our children we explain and enforce consequences, because in doing this we hold not only ourselves accountable for our actions (or lack thereof, and hence the need to apologize and explain our actions to kids so they don't misinterpret/internalize/think they were the reason for how we did/didn't act)."
Without your feedback his efforts are likely to sink under the radar and be lost.
Women process and ultimately make sense of emotions and problems by talking them through.
Work both sides.
Yeah that will definitely work really well.
"Yes, I indeed read the article and it also conveys that maternal-daughter toxicity is an overwhelming reality that impacts daughters only while mothers remain either blissfully unaware or revel in their power."
Yet she should be aware of not transmitting her own body concerns onto her daughter.
You are partially right when you stated that the OP'S attitude says more about the OP than her mother.
"You are the model, often the only model, for showing your son how intimate relationships work - the handling of differences, showing affection and respect, managing your own emotions."
You are toxic and sound like your projecting.
"You claim that you are neither a therapist nor psychologist, yet you seem to have the causes of mother-daughter conflict all figured out - even assuming these issues are playing out in MY personal life."
You do not know what the has been through or whether her mother deserves her hatred or not.
"You don't always need to be calm, but you do need to be clear and sensitive."
"You don't need to be perfect, but you need to be proactive."
You have the opportunity to be his greatest teacher.
You make a lot of very unprofessional and unscientific assumptions.
"You may become hyper vigilant in your own relationships (friends, significant others, younger family members, co-workers, et camera)--making sure that the reason that they are treating you badly for reasons unknown to you--is not YOUR fault (even though you've analysed and even asked and they've stated as much)."
"You may play a video-game together, you might wrestle, watch TV, read a book, bake a cake."
"You might be surprised how your conversation evolves over time, and what insights your son will bring to the table."
"You say that you are not mired in bitterness and hatred, yet you bitterly talk about your mother being precious and spoiled."
You'll be surprised at the difference it can make in him and you.
You're not doing our daughters any favours by promoting such disparaging views of motherhood.
"You're teaching him that it's important to be aware of your impact on others, and when it's hurtful, not what you intended, you step up and say so."
Your attitude says more about you than her.
