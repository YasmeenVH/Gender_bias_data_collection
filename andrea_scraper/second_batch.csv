"When you look at it, the people who know how to be attractive get everything theyve always wanted in life."
Were not just talking about being born the beautiful daughter of two famous supermodel parents.
Were talking about true beauty.
The kind of irresistible charisma of a person who has worked hard on making their lives incredible.
Do you know people like this?
Maybe its one of your friends.
She walks into the room and steals everyones breath by the sheer force of her presence.
"Shes funny, smart, kind, and personable."
You miss her when shes not there.
She has all the great qualities that know just how to attract a man.
Whats keeping you from being that person?
She wasnt born charming!
She didnt pop out of her mother and immediately start in with an anecdote about the cute guy who helped her find her binky.
Being charismatic is something you have to learn.
"Although your genes make you crave fascinating people, they donEUR(TM)t give you the blueprint on how to be attractive."
So what do you do?
Where do you start?
It all starts with the definition of attraction.
"Obviously, the appearance of health, beauty, and good genetics is near the top of everyones list, but what does that mean?"
Why do most hotties also have so many other great characteristics?
Pay attention here: they get complimented their whole lives.
They are given almost everything they want.
People throw themselves at a beautiful persons feet begging to be trampled.
"So maybe this doesnt happen to you, but it doesnt have to for you to understand whats really happening here."
"Its all the attention that brings them unstoppable confidence (it also gives them an irrational insecurity, but thats another story)."
"If everyone always told you how fabulous you are, its no stretch to start believing it."
Do you really need the grovelers to pump up your self confidence?
Hell no!
"When you understand that youre awesome without needing some dork in a bar to tell you so, this is true esteem and its irresistible!"
"Once you believe youve got the goods, you already know how to attract a man."
Stop waiting for a man to define you!
Hoping for a guy to come along and save you is not part of how to be attractive.
You need to make yourself the person you want to be.
Make a great life for yourself.
"Discover your own happiness and I promise, when that amazing man finally comes along, youll not only have to skills to catch him, youll also know you to keep him in your life."
This section is the how to guide to make yourself irresistible to men.
Were going to makeover your entire life into something even a man would be jealous of.
"Some of it might not be so obvious, like how to be rich, but think about it this way: are you looking for a dude that cant pay his own bills?"
Neither is he?
Holy Moley!
Thats a lot of stuff!
It sure is.
One way to look at this so its not so scary is to consider working small aspects of all of this great information into your life every week.
Thats right: baby steps.
Dont think that you can do all of this in a day or even a month.
Every day should be a new commitment on another aspect of how to be attractive.
Just imagine yourself a year from now looking back to these moments and seeing how far youve come and how much youve grown.
You are going to be so proud of what youve accomplished?
and your hot new boyfriend will be too!

"Before we figure out if this cute, but tastefully shy guy will ask you out on a first date, we must first see whether he is interested in you."
All signs point to yes?
Great!
Now we just need to get a guy to ask you out.
There is a lot of subtle persuasion that goes into getting a guy to make the first move.
Why?
Because a majority of men are afraid to get rejected.
Blame it on evolution.
We are not too far off from our furry ancestors who lived in small tribes.
There werenEUR(TM)t too many women savages to choose from.
"When a guy made his move, everyone knew about it."
"And if he got shot down, he lost his chance (often permanently) to further his genes."
Seems ridiculous now that there are several billion people on earth Guys still deal with this very real fear.
Sometimes making that first move seems easier than jumping out of an airplane.
Dont let this get you down and realize its not your fault!
"The reality is that if you have been sending signals and he does not take steps to ask you out, most likely its because hes scared of rejection."
You cannot believe how magical this line works!
Heres how it works: you two talk about anything and he mentions anything hes about to do.
You should immediately say Are you asking me to go with you?
"Whatever he mentions something hes about to do, make it an opportunity for him to say yes."
"Obviously, this is situation dependent."
You cant really go scuba diving with him if youve never done it before.
"If this one doesnt work, you have another easy option."
Mention something you are going to do soon and excitedly tell him hed love doing it also.
"He might try to invite himself along, but if hes one of the more clueless fellas out there, tell him he needs to come along."
This is as low pressure as it gets.
You were already on your way so you should go there together.
He did not think about logistics or which cologne to wear or who pays what.
Its just a seemingly harmless chance to get to know each other better.
"If he even likes you a little, he will totally say yes."
How can you get past his caveman fear of rejection quickly?
Flirt!
Flirt flirt Flirt!
He needs to know that you are nice and this lowers his chances of being embarrassed.
Compliments are great for this.
Saying things like Youre so brilliant should always be followed with the reason.
"You are so adorable how you saved those puppies from a burning building More realistically, you can say something like, I love it when you stick your tongue out when your concentrating."
Make him feel understood and hell have no choice but ask you out on a date.
Give him a chance to show you his talents by forcing him to show you.
"If he mentions playing an instrument or mentioning something hes proud of, tell him youd really like to see him do exactly what he just described."
"When you can make a guy feel useful because of his extensive knowledge of everything, it will spark some of those same happy feelings towards you."
Fear of rejection paralyses so many people in this world.
You can help him along by guiding him towards the actions you want from him.
Try to work your way into his world by asking him questions about whatever he finds interesting.
You can get a guy to ask you out simply by giving him a perfect way to talk to you.
You accomplish this by discussing a topic heEUR(TM)s very comfortable with as your cornerstone.
"If you know hes got a hobby or a sport or a pastime that he puts a lot of time into, you can read up about it and ask him a question about it the next time you see him."
"For example, if hes an avid golfer you can ask what happens if he cant find his ball."
"You might already know the answer to this question, but it gives him a chance to feel like hes an expert and that really emboldens a man especially when you want him to ask you out."
"The longer you wait around trying to get a guy to ask you out, the worse your chances become."
People go all throughout their lives regretting missed connections.
"He could worship the ground you walk on, but feel powerless to ask you out for a number very important but meaningless reasons."
You will have to make most of the first moves before he actually makes his.
"Sometimes, you might even have to make ALL the first moves."
"But as long as you stay flirty and fun and not try to be completely over the top in his face, he will start to notice and he will work up the courage."
My question is this: Wouldnt it be better to just be the girl that everyone wants to ask out?
Maybe you need a secret weapon Maybe you need to know how to be irresistible to men.
You might never need to wonder how to get a guy to ask you out again!
Back to top of Get a Guy to Ask You Out  Back to First Dates
I seem to always blow it on first dates.
Got any first date tips that can help a girl figure a little bit more out about the guy sitting across from me?
"When it comes to the purpose of first dates and first date tips, there are several things at play here."
The first and most important reason you are on this first date is to figure out if the guy youre with is at all interesting to you.
He may be cute.
He may be stylish.
"He may even be rich, but if hes boring and stupid, get ready for a lifetime of boring and stupid"
The first secret to first date tips is to pay attention!
Stop worrying about how youre blowing it or how embarrassing you are acting.
Hes totally worried about how hes doing too.
Get out of your head and into his.
"Even cute, stylish, rich guys can be pathetically uninteresting."
You need to figure this out before it goes any further so you can decide whether you let him get closer or if heEUR(TM)s just worth a few free dinners!
What are the first date tips to getting him to show who he really is?
Ask a ton of questions!
"In the end, what he drives or what he does for work isnt as important as how he feels about his life."
"If hes rich, but he hates his 80 hour a week job, hes bound to be permanently miserable."
Dont assume for a second that this misery wont spill over into your relationship.
You have to ask the right questions.
"The book  1000 Questions for Lovers by the legendary most romantic man alive, Michael Webb, not only gives you the right questions to consider, it also helps you by really getting him to open up."
It usually takes a few months to really get to know someone.
"By that time, you might already be in love with a guy who doesnEUR(TM)t deserve you."
You counteract that by getting your mysterious first date to spill the beans.
My favorite of the great first date tips is to take care of everything you can before the first date.
"But once youEUR(TM)re there, drop it."
"What, exactly does that mean?"
It means that you should try to take care of every variable before you arrive at the first date all adorable.
"Specifically, it means take care of anything that could possibly embarrass you later."
"Things like shaving your legs (or whatever), wearing your sexy undies, makeup, etc."
are pretty obvious.
"What Im talking about is cleaning out your car, cleaning up your house (especially your bedroom), stocking the fridge with a variety of drinks, doing your dishes, all the way to fixing that problem with your car."
A car wash wont hurt either.
"Slow down, sister!"
Its only a first date!
"Even if it goes completely against logic, moral codes, or possible reality, we all like to think that this might be that one perfect date with a perfect guy."
You never know whats going to happen!
So you should be prepared for any possibility.
What if his car breaks down or he gets a little tipsy and needs to come up to your place?
Running around your house pulling down your panties drying on the lampshades or the stack of pizza boxes next to the front door makes you look like a jerk.
Making excuses like its not normally this messy makes you look like a lying slob.What if your well-deserved and super-sexy makeout session involves him running his hand down your sandpaper thighs?
"Even if thats too racy for you, how about that final peck on the cheek is met with your garlic breath and body odor since you forgot to buy deodorant and didnt bring gum?"
One of the best first date secrets is to be prepared.
"This all seems like overkill, but if you always made the best impression for all your first dates, your entire life might get way more organized."
Sexy first dates and a made bed?
Win-win!
"So youve made yourself smoothe and sexy, made your car spotless, maybe even re-wallpapered your living room now let it go."
You can only do so much and I promise you that youll forget something crazy like leaving some random feminine hygene product on your bathroom counter or left your Barney and Friends CD in the CD player of your car.
This first date tip is simply: dont worry about it.
Get into your first date and be present.
Stop thinking about how you look.
Theres nothing else you can do now that hes sitting there in front of you.
"If you actually just met the man of your dreams and your kicking yourself for not cleaning up your house, forget it."
Theres nothing you can do about it right now.
"When you spend this perfect first date worried about all the things you forgot, you might miss out on some key details."
"This one is so obvious, but we all seem to get caught by it every single time."
Pay attention to what he says especially if itEUR(TM)s delivered jokingly.
"We all use this at the beginning of every relationship so we feel that weve been honest about our shortcomings and when we go crazy later, theyve been warned."
Some people just cant shut up on first dates.
"Theyll tell you every negative thing about themselves, but deliver it jokingly."
"You both laugh, but you almost always find out he wasnt trying to be funny."
He was actually warning you that he has a third arm growing out of his back.
"That might be a little extreme, but when a guy laughs about the things hes obsessed over (that you hate) or all the stuff he hates (that you adore), hes probably not actually joking."
This is one of the most important (and easiest to ignore) first date tips.
"Years later when you are driven mad by his poisonous spider collection, he might actually throw it back in your face that he told you on your first date about this creepy obsession."
"You might think back and remember him saying something like, Oh you cant come over, you might let out my spider collection!"
Ha ha ha!
Jokes are not always funny.
Pay attention to what this guy might really be saying.
Get used to this.
Really let it sink in.
Silence is great!
"Many women think that those lulls in conversation are horrible, but consider this very important first date tip: men dont chat like you might."
"In fact, he might not be much of a talker at all."
"If communication in relationships is really important to you, than shut up."
Sit there in silence for awhile and see how he continues the conversation.
If he doesnt (or cant) youve just saved yourself an eternity of miserable awkward silence.
"Seriously, be quiet and let him carry the conversation for awhile."
"Only stop to ask him questions about what hes telling you like, how did that make you feel?"
and that must have been amazing!
Then ask him about some kind of ideal situation like best vacation or favorite things to do on weekends.
Dont let this first date tip slip by you.
Be quiet.
Let him talk.
"A good rule of thumb is that if you just said something strange or hes got a funny look on his face, stop talking, ask him something about his childhood and let him tell you about his life."
"If you follow these first date tips, you will come away from your first date with just about everything you need to decide whether youEUR(TM)d be interested in a second date."

"Question submitted by Trini, 29, Victoria, British Columbia"
What are some signs that he is into you?
"Trying to decode guy into English can be difficult sometimes, especially it you have one of those silent types on your hands."
"However, if you know how to look, guys arent so difficult to figure out."
The key thing to look out for when looking for signs he is into you is how much hes around.
"If a guy is really into you, he will make it a point to be seen as much as he possibly can even to the point of maybe being a little creepy."
"And as long as you have him coming back for more, you have a great chance at landing this guy!"
Are you truly ready for him?
Having a guy who likes you wont make any difference if you dont have the skills to seal the deal.
You need some expert advice on How to be The Woman Men Adore to really understand on a fundamental level how to keep a man infatuated with you.
Has this guy done anything special to catch your eye?
Maybe he dresses better around you or is wearing some kind of cologne.
"If you can spot anything heEUR(TM)s doing to draw attention to himself, you can bet this is one of the sure signs he is into you."
"Some guys are way more subtle, but there is an inescapable urge to try to impress the girl hes got the hots for that drives men to incredible (and often embarrassing) excess."
"For a guy who doesnt have all of his cards on the table, you need to decode a little deeper."
Pay attention to the things you find impressive about him.
"Did you figure it out on your own, or did he tell you about the thing that impressed you?"
This indicates his effort to impress you.
"Even if itEUR(TM)s something very small, but has affected you all the same, just pay attention to how you get your information."
"This might feel like its way too forward for you, but it works perfectly on any guy."
"Even when it backfires, it will let you know whithout a doubt whether hes into you or not."
The trick here is to do it in a semi-intimate situation.
This can be anywhere where theres not a zillion people all watching you.
Stare him down using your cute look or even a predator look.
"We dont want you to look like a maniac, so practice it in the mirror (and no, its not ANY look that involves you making a kissy face: that never looks good on anyone)."
"So while you are gazing at him in a reasonably private situation, how does he react?"
"If he looks away first and then looks right back at you, you are probably dealing with a shy guy who is definitely showing signs he is into you!"
"If he stares you down until you look away, its a little bit more difficult to decipher."
He might just be a very confident guy.
"So when you look away and then look back, its very crucial to smile a little bit and flash your eyes."
"For an explanation of this, check out eye contact flirting to learn how to say everything with your eyes."
The final (and not so great) thing that could happen is that he makes a smarmy comment about you staring at him.
"But even then, you still might have a chance."
Its all in how he says whatever he says.
"If he says it in a funny way while smiling, the you are in!"
"If he says it in a mean way or insults you loud enough for others to hear, then he might actually just be a jerk."
Now you know that a jerk doesnt like you and youve saved all the time looking for signs he is into you.
"He might give you no clue when he makes his comment, in that case, its probably best to simply assume hes not showing signs he is into you."
"Besides, dating guys who never show any indication of interest usually arent good at showing affection either."
Dating guys with the emotional range of a carrot makes for a painfully boring relationship anyway
"When looking for signs he is into you, it important to realize that if you really have the goods and the confidence and the personality, it really doesnEUR(TM)t matter what he thinks right now, because when you really show him how awesome you are, he will find you irresistible!"

It happens to calmest among us.
Dealing with jealousy in some form or another pops up in all relationships.
"When it happens in a long distance relationship, it might just destroy it."
Lets start with the most obvious thing.
Dont date a guy with jealousy problems.
Jealousy is one of those gateway emotions.
It does not accomplish anything and it shows how insecure someone is.
"When you get jealous, how does it make you feel?"
How do you react?
"When a guy feels this way, he always expresses it as anger, but he can also show it as violence."
"And once he goes for violence, things will only get worse."
Maybe its also time to look at yourself.
Do you always seem to attract jealous guys?
Guys like this tend to be controlling and are seeking women they can boss around.
Are we saying youre weak?
Only you know that.
"But no matter what your heart tells you, there are tons of ways to get yourself out of these situations."
One of our favorites is a great audio course teaching you  how to get your confidence back.
"Once you really understand how great you are, problems like jealousy in relationships magically disappear because youll no longer attract small-minded men anymore!"
Does that make sense?
Jealous guys always fall for a certain type of woman: one that he can hold power over.
"If you are the kind of girl with unstoppable confidence, youll never get another guy like this in your life again!"
"If you want a guy fighting for your honor all the time, then date a jealous guy."
The problem is that it never stops with him smacking the losers who hit on you at the bar.
It often spills into your family and professional life.
He might want to beat up your boss or your male cousin.
You know that guy youve been best friends with since preschool?
Youll have to lose him too just to keep the peace.
Even then it doesnt stop there.
Men who have problems like these will run away all your friends and keep tabs on where you are and who youre talking to.
Girls Night Out?
He wont let you do that anymore.
Anything that you might be able to get in trouble?
Nope.
Forbidden.
The goal of the jealous boyfriend is to get you away from anyone who is going to tell you how controlling he is.
Plus he can keep tabs on you to keep you out of trouble.
Are you really so much of a child?
!
"One day, you might get sick of his jealousy and leave him."
Studies have shown that most ex-boyfriend stalkers were always dealing with jealousy.
"After getting dumped, they took on the if I cant have her, no one can mentality."
That is really scary!
Jealousy is a terrible emotion that makes people do terrible things.
"Fortunately, jealous guys are relatively easy to spot."
They get angry easily and they watch over you intently.
"Maybe on the first few dates, hell mention fights hes been in."
"If he shows any signs of using violence to settle his problems, jealousy is usually not far behind."
"It might seem cool that you have a manly man that can protect you, but unless you live in a dangerous part of the world, needing a guy who is readily willing to fight is an outdated idea."
Dealing with jealousy starts with how you feel about the men in your life.
"Men that are ready for violence might seem sexy and forbidden, but they also come with all kinds of other problems."
The best advice on dealing with jealousy: stop it from the very beginning.
"The first time he shows this kind of insecurity, dump him."
"ThatEUR(TM)s right, we said dump him!"
"Even if you totally love this guy, dump him."
Jealous boyfriends are emotional guys.
You need to show him how serious you are about not needing that kind of drama in your life.
But I LOVE him!
Yeah yeah Of course you do.
"However, you need to do this to deal with his jealousy and make your point clear."
"Were not saying you cant take him back, but you can not take him back until its clear to you that he has learned his lesson."
"If you do take this emotional man back, you have to make it clear that you will not tolerate his jealous behavior and that is the only condition on which you will let him back in your life."
You will be amazed at how asserting yourself like this will change him.
There will be times when he will try to act jealous again and you must stop him in his tracks Immediately!
The truth about people is that they will usually comply if they are told something with enough authority.
This is why we cant say enough about getting unstoppable confidence.
You can get everything you want if you feel you deserve it.
"What if hes the type of guy who wont listen or worse, gets angry when people tell him what to do?"
"Girl, this is a bad situation."
Some guys hate it when their girlfriends try to assert themselves.
They want a submissive woman.
You wont have much choice in this one.
You dont have much choice on dealing with jealousy.
You will have to let him go.
Think about that for a second Things will only get worse when your boyfriend is jealous and dangerous.
Anything short of making him take an anger management course all spells out an ending whether its by you leaving or by you getting a restraining order or worse!
Dealing with jealousy is kind of addicting.
You get all of this drama and something to talk to your friends about.
You get the suspense of the uncertain nature of your boyfriends anger.
Plus you get the intensity of making up after a big fight.
You need to believe that you really dont need this in your life.
Having a jealous boyfriend is as much your fault as it is his.
What if its you with the problem?
"Girl, you gotta kill it now so it does not ruin your relationship all of your relationships."
Maybe you cant help it.
"OK, lets work with that."
"If you really have a serious problem dealing with jealousy, then dont date player men."
"If hes always flirting with other women and it throws you into a rage, stop putting yourself in these positions."
"The description of the man above, that could be you."
Do you really want to be the person your boyfriends have to fear?
Nothing has ever been made better through jealousy.
It drives a wedge down the middle of your relationship and prevents you from gaining total trust and love from your man.
You should check out a great book called No More Jealousy that helps you find the source of these jealous feelings and changes the way you think about yourself and your man.
"If youEUR(TM)re man is jealous, FORCE HIM to read this book!"
Our advice: never allow it.
It will only get worse.
"If you have issues dealing with jealousy, go get counseling and definitely check out the confidence building audio course."
Find out why you feel this way and figure out how to avoid it before it breaks up the best relationship you've ever had.

Some guys just cant be trusted.
"When learning how to spot a cheater, there are many factors to consider."
"Of course, a lot of these traits are generalizations."
"You can meet a guy who has some of these traits, but will be faithful."
Its important to follow your heart and never convince yourself that he is better than what he appears to be.
Our goal here is to identify cheating men before you fall in love with him.
"Although some of these qualities are just guidelines, there is nothing more powerful than your own intuition."
"If he seems shady or dangerous to your heart, there is an overwhelming chance that he probably is going to be a cheater."
The problem arises when this is actually something youre attracted to.
"Its OK to like the bad boys, but just keep in mind how hurt youll be if he actually cheats on you."
"If youre already involved and need to figure out your options, its best that you read a lot more on this subject."
"The book  How to Catch a Cheatis not only invaluable for really helping you get into the mind of a cheater, it also helps you to really be on the look out for the little signs that we all notice but tell ourselves theyre meaningless."
"We found it great because not only does it help you find out for sure if hes cheating, but it also helps you understand when your relationship is failing."
There are men in this world who are exceedingly charming.
They are entertaining and comfortable in any situation.
Then there are the guys who get a little too close and try a little too hard around other women.
These are the guys you need to watch out for.
"Even if they dont have a very impressive game, eventually someone will say yes to his advances and now hes cheating on you."
Overly forward guys are big warning signs on how to spot a cheater and avoid him.
"If hes doing it in front of you, then hes usually ten times worse when he does not have someone watching over him."
"Thats not to say that all flirty guys cheat, but they are way ahead of their peers in the ability to go for it."
"And most of the time, cheating is a game of opportunity."
If your man never puts himself in the position to have an opportunity to cheatEUR
Inconsistency is the best way to spot a cheater.
"Lets face it, most people in this world are very predictable."
You only have to know them for a very short time to get a feel for their schedule and how they react in most situations.
"The moment he becomes inconsistent, either with the way he acts or thinks or treats you, you can tell right away that somethings going on."
This is a general trait that most cheaters share.
"If they are always tending to their needs, the bond he may share with you might not mean so much if he gets the right kind of temptation."
Keep on the lookout for any selfish behavior early in the relationship.
"If you have a self-serving guy, you might also have a cheater on your hands."
Sorry we have to add this one.
"An adventure seeker is a great thing to look for in a boyfriend, itEUR(TM)s also a way to spot a cheater if only a potential one."
"Unfortunately, everything to some guys like this is a conquest."
A man who is always in search of danger or new experiences might not have a problem with infidelity since it feeds into his quest for the forbidden.
Some guys are just hard to get a hold of.
"Then again, some guys dont answer their phones when they are ahem busy."
How good is he at answering his phone?
"If hes always picking up on the first ring, but some nights he does not answer at all"
"Speaking of his cellphone, does he turn the ringer off when hes with you or does he ignore his phone ringing sometimes?"
That is a great give away on how to spot a cheater.
"Maybe he answers his phone, but talks in a whisper."
Another warning sign.
"If he left a girlfriend or wife to be with you, you can make a pretty safe bet that the same thing is going to happen to you."
This also includes if he dated anyone who was married or in a relationship.
"I know, that seems like less of an infraction, but it shows that he might not put a high value on other peoples feelings."
"If he ever admits to cheating before, take it as a get out of jail free card."
"You dont need to ask how to spot a cheater, youve already spotted him."
Dont get involved with him.
So is he a cheater?
What do you do now?
Can you save the relationship?
"Once again, a brilliant book has been written on this subject."
Should You Stay or Should You Go asks all the questions you need to consider when thinking about leaving a shaky relationship.
"Maybe he did cheat on you, but is he truly sorry and willing to try to change?"
Weigh the pros and cons about your man and find out if heEUR(TM)s worth saving.
The key point in how to spot a cheater is to follow your feelings about him.
Go with your raw feeling and dont try to add any convincing in with it.
"You know, when you tell yourself that hes all about you and does not need anyone else."
"Some say, Once a cheater, always a cheater."
You need to decide if he can change for you and if hes even worth it.
Back to top of How to Spot a Cheater  Back to Infidelity
The signs of infidelity are pretty easy to spot if you know what to look for.
"Once you read this article, some things might jump right out at you."
Some things will be more difficult to pinpoint.
"If hes showing all of the signs of an affair and its that obvious, Its likely to mean that hes been doing it for a long time and has gotten careless in covering up his tell-tale signs of infidelity."
WARNING: sometimes you just dont want to know.
Sometimes its easier to just act like nothing is wrong.
This is where people get into bigger trouble than they were trying to avoid.
How is that possible?
How could him cheating on me not be the worst thing to have happen?
He could give you sexually transmitted disease.
He could have children with the woman (or women) hes sleeping with.

Should You Stay or Should You Go is a lifesaver!
"No one should have to go through something like this alone, but we all do."
You will look back at these moments years from now and feel shame in the decisions youEUR(TM)ve made UNLESS you get some real perspective and make deliberate and well-thought-out decisions.
And now for the signs of infidelity.
"Keep in mind, some people just act this way."
You must compare the way he is currently acting with how heEUR(TM)s been with you in the past.
"This one is the least tangible of the signs of infidelity, but somethings wrong."
Hes acting removed or secretive.
He might even be acting happier and animated.
"Although this might be a welcome breath of fresh air that hes floating around like a wood nymph, he could actually be acting this way because hes getting his freak on with his secretary."
Dont doubt your intuition.
"If you think something is up, then theres a really good chance that you are right."
Hes acting weird and its making you suspicious.
Dont push these thoughts away.
Explore them.
Are you being perceptive or are you just being paranoid?
"The better you know yourself, the easier this step is."
Some dudes feel so guilty about cheating on you that they will be afraid to touch you.
"Some dudes will get so invigorated by some side action, that he will bring his new found knowledge into your bedroom."
"If hes not touching you at all or hes breaking out moves that are way beyond his previous interests in sex, then hes showing one of the most classic signs of infidelity."
What if there never was that much sex to begin with?
Shame on you!
"If hes not cheating now, hell definitely be thinking about it."
Men use sex as one of their very few outlets to release stress and gain some kind of renewal.
"If hes not getting any, you can bet his mind is racing."
"Since you are the only one that can help this relationship, you need to be a bit more active in initiating sex."
Lets face it.
"If that guy gets any underwear, youre usually the one getting it for him."
"If his tighty whities with the holes in the crotch get replaced with some leopard print banana hammocks, and hes the one who bought them, you can bet hes starting to care who sees him in his undies."
"He doesnt care that you see him in his ugly underwear because you love him, but he does car that the other girl might think hes a pig."
This is one of the most important signs of infidelity he can give you.
You saw him back in the day when he was ripped.
"As your love turned to comfort, he gradually lost interest in his looks and renewed his love for Doritos and beer."
"If hes now hitting the gym with the vigor of Conan the Barbarian, hes got influential reasons to do so"
"Now some guys get that scary wake-up call from their doctors and decide that their health is an important goal, but if he starts working out for no apparent reason, he might be interested in looking good in those leopard print banana hammocks!"
Cheaters have cheating on their minds.
"Once they see that they did it and got away with it, theyll think you might know something that they just discovered."
"If hes accusing you of cheating on him, especially if its out of the blue and for no apparent reason, then he knows something"
This is a giant red flag for the signs of infidelity.
Cheaters will always put things in the terms of their own experiences.
"LetEUR(TM)s face it, if someone is always deleting their history and covering their tracks on their computer, you can guaranty they are not hiding their Hello Kitty fixation."
"Sure he could be hiding all the pornography hes looking at, but you know his email address."
"If you come across a new email address, odds are, hes got it for other activities."
There are websites like  AshleyMadison  that are all about having an affair.
"If hes got a different email address, it might be used to hide something secret."
One of the surefire signs of infidelity is that heEUR(TM)s never around anymore.
Somehow he has been forced to spend late hours at the office or gets called away inconveniently or unexpectedly.
So now he finds himself making tons of excuses as to why he has to leave or will be home very late or even go away on a job related trip.
Does his job really require him to leave town for a weekend?
Be afraid especially if he usually takes you along and now you are no longer invited.
Guilt can do a number on someoneEUR(TM)s conscious.
They make up for it by getting you something nice.
A sort of payment for your unknowing silence.
"Dont get me wrong, Im a big fan of gifts for no reason and this shouldnt be a reason to question the appearance of great gifts, but if this is just one of the many signs of infidelity, than its best you dont throw away the box it came in just in case"
You gotta get the stink of another woman off of your somehow.
"When your man comes home form work, they smell like they always do: the normal smell of a body thats been in his clothes all day long (or food if hes in the food industry, etc.)."
"If he smells like a fresh shower, somethings up."
"Maybe he showered at the gym (due to his new fixation on health), but you love this guy."
You know what he smells like.
"If he is consistently smelling different, he might be having an affair."
"If youre really freaked out, this is the last place you should look."
The smell of sex gets transferred into his underwear even if he was using a condom.
"If you really have to know, buy him some new underwear and make sure its black."
"If those tell-tale white smudges occur in his underwear on days that you know for sure that you didnt sleep together, then hes showing you his signs of infidelity without saying a word."
Please note: Doing a daily underwear check is kinda freaky and will drive you crazy so only do this one as a last resort.
"Condoms, phone calls where someone hangs up, lipstick smears, perfume, an extra set of clothes in his car, receipts, large phone bills, not answering his phone, his phone being dead all the time These are all indications that he could be having an affair."
All of these add up to something being wrong and you need to figure out where to go from here.
"If youve ever cheated on someone and gotten away with it, you know how empowering it feels."
Its like youve been told your whole life that eating ice cream will kill you.
"And then one day, by accident, you eat some and discover that not only are you still alive, ice cream is delicious!"
The same principle applies to infidelity.
Youve been told your whole life that its bad and you will get caught.
"Once you do it and get away with it, it gives you a kind of invincible feeling."
"Im not saying that people dont and cant change, but if your love is showing all these signs of infidelity, its likely hes been doing it for a long time."
Hes like the tiger whos tasted human flesh
"For now, its imperative you check out Should You Stay or Should You Go to really examine what actions you need to take now that youve discovered the signs of infidelity."
"Sometimes, the first step is the hardest, but you dont have to do it alone."

"If youEUR(TM)ve caught your man in an emotional affair, here are some things you need to consider:"
"Question Submitted by, Confused from California"
My husband is in an emotional affair.
I caught him cheating by finding his phone records.
He had been calling the same number for four months.
I had no idea he was cheating because he did not follow any of the normal signs of cheating.
I checked up on him because it was happening to a girlfriend and it made me wonder.
"When I confronted him, he admitted to several meetings with this other woman and phone conversations."
"No actual intercourse, touching or kissing."
All of a sudden he has been acting as if I am diserable to him.
Wanting more affection than usual.
I am so confused.
Should I believe him?
Why is he wanting me more than he ever has before?
Is an emotional affair really that big of a deal?
Please help me.
Emotional cheating happens when someone in a relationship gets involved with someone else on a deep emotional level.
This doesnt (or doesnt yet) involve sex or physical contact.
"If you ask 100 people whether an emotional affair is as bad as a sexual affair, you will hear 100 different answers."
Some people think its fine as long as there is no sex.
Some people think its worse than a sexual affair because the emotional connection he build with another woman could lead to LOVE.
Some people think that any cheating is cheating.
The jury is also out on what to do after an emotional affair.
Do you dump him?
Is the relationship worth saving?
Did he really do something that bad?
Now is a really hard space to be in for the victim of emotional cheating.
So where are you with this whole situation?
"On one hand, hes seeking closeness with another woman."
"On the other, it didnt reach the level of a full blown affair."
Whats a girl to do?
Its time to really investigate how you really feel right now?
It all starts with asking yourself the really tough questions: how much do you really love this guy?
what does a split or a divorce mean to you and your plans for the future?
Can you get back to trusting him?
There is an excellent resource you need to really get a handle on where YOU ARE emotionally.
"The book,  Should You Stay or Should You Go will point you in the right direction."
It goes through all the things you should be considering right now.
"If you are confused about where to go from here in any way, this book helps give you clarity on how to move forward in a smart way that is best for you."
Dont make any decisions about this emotional affair that you will regret later without knowing EXACTLY how you will feel about it in the future.
Regret is one of the worst emotions
"Unfortunately, most people consider sex to be end-all definition of infidelity."
The fact remains that he is getting really close with another person that he could start an all-in affair with.
"Sure there might be all kinds of circumstances that prevent both of them from actually going into the sexual side of this relationship, but what is really happening here?"
He is searching for an emotional connection with someone else that he doesnt have with you.
"Before you get too upset of that statement or defend yourself with, We have an EMOTIONAL connection!, consider that there are all kinds of emotional connections you can have with someone."
Anyone can tell you this if they have ever dated someone way too smart or way too stupid for them.
"When dating someone way smarter than you, there will always be aspects of communication that you just wont get."
Theres that missing piece of the connection that will never fully meet.
"If hes way too stupid, you find yourself dumbing down what you talk about just to engage him."
"There are thousands of different ways that two people cant connect and especially in long-term relationships, this is exactly what we find ourselves craving."
"In relationships where two people are of vastly different ages, both seek to talk to someone who shared their generational issues."
"In relationships where both people are very masculine or feminine in their interactions, they sometimes crave someone who is their girlfriends or wifes opposite."
"These days, its a snap to get online an have an internet affair."
"To him, it seems completely harmless as long as no sex happens."
"Yes, you definitely have a connection with him, the issue is when he is seeking an personality trait that you dont have."
Then youll find him on the road to an emotional affair to get what he doesnt from you.
The important thing to take away from this is to realize that this behavior is completely natural.
Seeking the interactions we cant get from the one we love happens all the time.
"There is something that feels like home in these people, like finding someone who reminds him of his mother (or other female figures from his past)."
Sweet!
Heres where things get good!
Recovering from an emotional affair and making your relationship as strong as it was takes three things.
The first and most important step is to put him on a quest!
He got caught and feels like an ass which is why he is so much more affectionate with you than he was before.
He wants to make things right and turning ultra-sexual is his best idea.
"It might not be the best idea for you, but hes trying to commit and this is the way he thinks he can win you back."
Its time to really give him a chance to make things right for you.
There is no better way than Rousing the Lion!
Its a downloadable book that you can get right away and start putting into action tonight.
We cant say enough amazing things about it.
Keeping your man (and keeping him in love) is a daily process.
This program teaches you to think about love and turn your man back into a warrior.
A guy whos once again willing to fight for you.
"In the process, your man rediscovers how really awesome you are."
"If you give him something to fight for, he will prove himself and he will prove heEUR(TM)s sorry for his emotional affair."
The second step is to COMMUNICATE.
He got into emotional infidelity because there are things he felt he just couldnEUR(TM)t connect with you on.
Or maybe there are things that he keeps hidden because he feels you will judge him in one way or another.
He is desperate to communicate!
This is why the emotional affair happened in the first place.
Its time to have an Honesty Session where both of you get to say exactly what you are feeling.
"You have to promise each other, that you will NEVER exploit what is said or judge what is said."
This stuff needs to be heard in order to strengthen the relationship.
Be warned: he might say some things that might really hurt you if you dont pay attention to what he really wants.
"You can be devastated that he says hes not sexually attracted to you any more, OR you can be energized that its something so easy and commit to doing something about it!"
"You can choose to be crushed if he tells you that he got into an emotional affair with this other woman because she was so smart and well-traveled, OR you can advance your career with a College Degree."
First get yourself hooked up with some cheap to free financial aid and then choose a degree program in a growing career and show him you can be the smarty pants hes got the hots for!
See how this works?
"When you truly listen to the things he needs behind what he is saying, then you know what you can do to keep him."
"Weve already touched on this a little already, but the last step is to be be the best wife/girlfriend/lover you can possibly be."
He cant possibly stray to another emotional (or sexual) affair if you are irresistibly attractive on many levels.
Long relationships tend to stagnate.
People get comfortable and stop trying to captivate their loved ones.
Things get predictable and boring.
Never let this happen!
Keep your man on his toes.
The only way to do this is to realize that improving yourself is a permanent and life-long goal.
"If youEUR(TM)re not learning new stuff, finding new interests, discovering more about each other, working on being healthy, and reinventing yourself, your relationship (and all further relationships) is doomed to the same fate."
Lets start with the most pressing matter: your relationship.
How much do you really know about each other?
"Have you ever sat down and asked all the silly, interesting, and deep questions that youve always wanted to know?"
Now is the time to do it!

Discover who his heros are.
Find out what he values most.
And really get into his head and heart in a fun and meaningful way.
He wants sex.
Give it to him!
Now its more important than ever to explore your fantasies.
Hes desperate to please you and to have you forgive him for his emotional affair.
He wants back in your heart.
"If you can reach him with your sexuality, he will NEVER stray again."
"The book, The REAL Secrets of Sex is a great place to start."
Tell him what you want and impress him with your knowledge!
"Think about it as the whole you approach Its a whole new way of thinking that will put you in the mindset to being so awesome, so committed to being the lover, so into your man that he wont even consider another emotional affair."
Weve given you a lot of information about what to do after an emotional affair right here.
Its so easy to look at this huge list of required reading and decide its just not worth it.
"No matter if you stay in this relationship or not, one thing is certain: the better you are as a complete person, the better relationships will be."
"Whether you decide to stay with him or not, you will always find yourself in the same situations if you dont do something about it!"
Becoming the diva doesnEUR(TM)t happen over night.
This is something you must understand now that will take your whole life to accomplish.
That takes a little pressure off the situation.
"For now, you need to figure out how you feel about your husband, yourself, and the emotional affair."
Be honest!
"Once you have figured out your situation, now its time to put him on a quest and start working on your life."
"Get one or two books now to get you on track, but definitely come back for more information as you read and apply what youve learned."
You could look at emotional affairs and internet infidelity as the crushing end to something that used to be so perfect.
"You could, or you could see it as a near miss to a tragic accident and a wake up call to do everything you can to make your relationship bulletproof."

"When you start wondering,  Is my man cheating, its time to ask yourself if something has changed."
Even great liars have trouble hiding their tracks.
Little things about him start to change.
He becomes secretive and starts doing things out of character.
"Infidelity is often a result of much bigger problems, but it forces you to ask yourself if the relationship is going anywhere and if its worth saving whether or not cheating has creeped in."
The whole concept of cheating is rooted in the notion of possession: He is mine and I dont want to share.
"Thats a perfectly fine way to feel about it, but a good question is what are you doing to keep your man and keep him happy?"
The best way to protect your relationships from cheaters is to do everything you can to make him happy.
Check out the book  How to be Irresistible to Men to see if you are doing everything you can to ensure that his eyes are only on you.
"Of course, being an awesome girlfriend or wife still doesnt change the fact that something isnt right."
The following list are the 11 top signs that hes cheating on you.
One warning though: all of these signs of infidelity should be compared to his previous actions and behavior.
"If he always gets weird when hes on his computer, then hes probably just looking at pornography."
"Thats an entirely different problem altogether (if you consider it one), but you can agree that its a lot better than actually cheating on you."
"Either way, you want to know and you want to know NOW."
"There is a great book, Bust Liars, That goes through all the things hell probably do when hes lying to you."
This book is some powerful stuff that every woman needs to protect herself and her relationship.
"If he starts to change his behavior including becoming cold or even super-loving, something has definitely happened in his life to make that change."
Not many people are that good at lying either.
Check out this great article on how to lie to see into the mind of a liar.
He might not actually even be cheating and only be depressed about something.
The only way to know for sure is to see if he gives you any of the signs of a cheater
Often a cheater will accuse you of cheating too.
He has either opened up his mind to the possibility that you are engaged in the same acts as him or hes just accusing you to throw you off his trail.
"Some dudes are just jealous, but when one accuses you of infidelity for no reason, be wary."
"When some men cheat, they start to lose all interest in you."
They are getting exactly what they need elsewhere so sex with you becomes unnecessary.
Some guys swing in the other direction and become hyper-sexual.
"Hes having so much fun and learning new things about his sexuality, he just cant keep his hands off you too."
He might even start experimenting in the bedroom.
"If he starts suggesting or attempting sexual acts that seem above your skill level or just a little too kinky, he might be learning new things from someone else."
"When his sexual urges take a serious and unexpected upturn, its time to start asking,  Is my man cheating?"
The lips dont lie.
"When passionate or happy kisses are replaced with the kind of kisses youd give to the creepier of your relatives, (even if hes not cheating) these are a serious indication that somethings wrong in the relationship."
Guilt is a very strong emotion and he might be avoiding contact with you because he is cheating on you.
Most guys have their style whether its t-shirts and jeans or button down shirts and slacks.
"When new clothing starts to show up in the wardrobe that seems unlike him or more stylish than usual, he might have infidelity on his mind."
"As a relationship progresses, people tend to get more comfortable and stop dressing as nice as they used to."
A new-found interest in his looks again might indicate he has someone else to look good for.
He might even take up a new interest in fitness that he never had before.
"Usually in couples, one of you will discuss the desire to start getting back in shape."
"If all of the sudden he has a gym membership and never discussed it with you, start feeling concerned for your relationship."
"Most women ask,  Is my man cheating on me as a result of how little they see of their boyfriends or husbands anymore."
Somehow he has been forced to spend late hour at the office or gets called away inconveniently or unexpectedly.
So now he finds himself making tons of excuses as to why he has to leave or will be home very late or even go away on a job related trip.
Does his job really require him to leave town for a weekend?
Be afraid especially if he usually takes you along and now you are no longer invited.
Does he freak out when you walk into the room and immediately switch what hes doing on the computer?
Has he now password protected his laptop or some part of his computer?
Is he erasing his web browsing history or doing things on the computer to cover his tracks?
Does he get on the computer after you have gone to bed or stay on it much longer than normal?
Is my man cheating on me?
Ummm probably.
Does he get wrong number calls or not answer his cellphone sometimes?
Does he leave the room to take some conversations?
Is he starting to end phone calls with me too?
"That is usually a response to someone telling him, I love you."
An excessive phone bill usually indicates long conversations with the same person.
He might even handle the phone bill on his own now to keep you from seeing it.
Remember to compare his current actions with the way he used to act.
"If hes always stepped out to take conversations and always get wrong numbers, then dont worry about it."
We are only looking for differences here.
"Before you even consider if hes cheating on you, he might start buying you gifts or giving you extra attention."
"Its pretty cool to get those just because gifts, but is this not really part of his personality."
"As we said, guilt makes a man do strange and unpredictable things."
Those gifts might just be payment to you for destroying your trust.
Do you two even use condoms anymore?
"If not, this is a 10 on the Is my man cheating on me scale."
Why would he have condoms?
Someone was handing them out on the street Yeah right!
"Be happy hes actually using condoms, but if he has them, hes using them."
You are fortunate you were born with a better sense of smell than a man.
"If he comes home smelling like someone elses perfume or smelling of sex, this is a dead giveaway."
"Granted, some women use smelly lotions and perfumes and all he has to do is give a handshake for the smell to transfer, but if you keep smelling the same smells over and over again, he is coming in close contact with the same woman."
He might all of the sudden start smelling like different soap or freshly showered when he comes home.
"If he has no't been to the gym, why would he have taken a shower at night?"
Or maybe he comes home and heads straight for the shower.
Warning!
"If you're really freaked out, this is the last place you should look."
The smell of sex gets transferred into his underwear even if he was using a condom.
"Snooping is a really bad thing, and this one is pretty creepy, but when you really need to know, this might be your last bit of information."
"When it comes to finding out if your man is cheating, you must ask yourself if hes giving you reason to be suspicious or are you just a jealous person?"
"Before you get too deep into your sleuthing, stop and consider what the consequences are if you start snooping and its not true."
"Thebook,  Catch a Cheat gives you all the ways to know for sure what your man is up to."
"If youve actually considered doing something like hiring a private eye, do yourself a favor and get this information first to see if its even necessary."
Make sure there are at least a few of the  Is my man cheating signs out there before you make any accusations.
Be ready for whatever answers he might give and decide what this means to the future of your relationship.
Do you forgive him?
Or do you start making plans to move on?
