Fathers who refuse to support their wives and engage in a power struggle to be the more popular parent present a source of conflict which the mother has few resources to manage.
Fathers are tempted to live vicariously through their sons and to push their sons to achieve what they did not.
Fathering a little son who wants nothing so much as to be 'just like my dad' is much easier than fathering an adolescent son who wants to follow his own agenda and be his own man.
